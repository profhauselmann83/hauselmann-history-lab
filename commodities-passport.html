        <h2>About This Activity</h2>
        <p>Between the 1400s and the 1900s, European expansion and colonialism radically redistributed a long list of goods, or <strong>commodities</strong>, such as silk, tea, silver, coffee, potatoes, and tobacco. These commodities traveled across continents, transforming economies, cultures, and lives along the way.</p>
        <p>In this activity, you will explore the "passports" of various commodities—documents that trace their origins, journeys, and impacts across the globe. As each commodity circulates through different time periods and regions, you'll learn about the places it went and the profound changes it brought.</p>

            <p>Cannabis, or hemp, is one of the oldest known domesticated crops. It is believed to be native to South Asia, especially in the Himalayan highlands of Northern India, Pakistan, and parts of Afghanistan. Since before recorded history, cannabis was valued for its many useful properties: its seeds and oil have nutritional and medicinal value; its fibrous stems can be used to make clothes and especially rope; and because of its hardiness, it can be adapted to many different climates.</p>
            <p>Of course, it was also valued for its psychoactive properties, which stem from the presence of a chemical known as THC. As a result, it was often used by holy men and mystics. Known as <em>ganja</em> in India, cannabis was often used by wandering holy men known as gurus. It was also used widely in the Middle East, often as a hard substance known as hashish. It is believed to have made its way into Spain during the Muslim conquest of Iberia in the 1300s.</p>

            <h2>🌶️ Chili Peppers Passport</h2>
            <p>From Ancient Mexico to Global Cuisine</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="period">
            <h3><span class="period-icon">PRE</span>Pre-1500s: Native to Central America</h3>
            <p>Hot, or chili, peppers are native to Central America. They were one of the earliest domesticated crops in Mexico, with evidence of their cultivation stretching back to 7500 BCE. They were an integral part of Native American cuisine, and often combined with cacao in the chocolate drinks consumed by Aztecs and others. They were spread by pre-Columbian trade from Mexico throughout the Caribbean.</p>
            <p>One theory as to why they became so valuable to Native populations is that the ingredient in them which makes them spicy, called capsicum, also produces a mild "high" and functions as a mild painkiller; it is also believed by some experts today that the sweating caused by the capsicum helps cool the body down—important in tropical areas. Peppers are also very rich in vitamin C, and some researchers believe they are especially beneficial to the immune system.</p>
            <p>Christopher Columbus and his crew were the first Europeans to encounter chili peppers on their first voyage in 1492–1493, during their encounter with Native Americans in the Caribbean. Columbus named them "pepper" because they reminded him of the spiciness of traditional pepper, or peppercorn, which was known in Europe at the time as an exotic Asian delicacy. One of the physicians aboard Columbus's ship brought them back to Spain in 1493 and began to write about their medicinal effects in 1494. Initially, they were cultivated in Europe only as a curiosity, often by monks in Spain, Portugal, and Italy.</p>

            <h3><span class="period-icon">16</span>1500s: Portuguese Spread to Africa and India</h3>
            <p>Portuguese explorers also discovered Amazonian Indians who ate wild hot peppers in South America in the early 1500s. From here, and from trade with the Spanish colonies, the Portuguese were the main vector that spread hot peppers throughout the world. One of the first places that the Portuguese spread the peppers to was West Africa, especially the Kingdom of the Congo, in the 1500s, as the peppers grew easily in the West African climate and were also a good used to trade in exchange for enslaved people.</p>
            <p>The Portuguese were among the first Europeans to establish colonies in South Asia, especially in India where they began trading outposts on the western coast in Goa, Calicut, and Cochin in the very early 1500s. Here, too, they spread hot peppers as one of the goods they could offer in exchange for other commodities, such as cotton cloth. As a result, the cuisine in that part of India became known for extremely spicy dishes.</p>

        <div class="period">
            <h3><span class="period-icon">17</span>1600s: To Indonesia, Middle East, and Hungary</h3>
            <p>The Portuguese continued to spread hot peppers wherever they explored, including the Spice Islands in Indonesia and in Southeast Asia by the 1600s. It is also believed that hot peppers found their way to the Middle East through contact with the Spanish during the 1600s, and from there found their way to Europe. In Hungary, they were referred to as "paprika," a key spice in many Hungarian dishes, including the national dish of Hungary, known as gulash.</p>

            <p>By the 1700s, the Portuguese had spread hot peppers to Asia. Especially in Southeast Asia, and in southern parts of China in East Asia such as Szechuan, Yunan, and Canton, where the quasi-tropical climate was well suited for their cultivation, hot peppers quickly became an integral part of the cuisine. To this day, Szechuanese, Cantonese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Indonesian food are renowned for their use of very hot peppers.</p>

            <p>Part of the reason that hot peppers have proved so popular throughout the world is that they are easy to grow, and it proved to be relatively easy to create new variations, or cultivars. For this reason, there are many newer varieties of peppers, from jalapeños to habaneros and even hotter varieties like the scotch bonnet and the scorpion pepper. Today, the hottest pepper in the world is cultivated in North America in North Carolina and is known as the "Carolina Reaper." It is almost ten times as hot as a habanero, which is still widely used in the Caribbean.</p>

            <h3><span class="period-icon">PRE</span>Pre-1500s: Aztec Treasure</h3>
            <p>Chocolate comes from the beans, or fruit, of the cacao tree, which can only grow in tropical conditions. Originating in the Amazon, it spread to Central America, where it became an important part of the culture of Native communities. It was probably the Olmecs of Central America that first made chocolate from cacao. The Mayans further developed it, making a drink out of it that was used in religious ceremonies, often mixing hot peppers, corn, and other ingredients into it.</p>
            <p>Chemicals in the cacao bean, known as alkaloids, produced a mild stimulant effect (this is why chocolate is believed to be addictive by some). This drink was often bitter, because sugarcane was unknown in the Western Hemisphere at the time.

        <div class="period">
            <h3><span class="period-icon">PRE</span>Pre-1500s: Ethiopian Origins</h3>
            <p>Coffee is believed to have originated in the highlands of Ethiopia, in eastern Africa. One legend of its discovery is that a goat herder noticed his goats having uncommon strength and energy after eating the green berries (which are the raw coffee beans) of the Coffea arabica tree. Some theories hold that since these trees originate close to the Rift Valley (they still grow wild there), which is where paleontologists believe the first humans evolved, the psychoactive properties of the coffee beans aided the development and evolution of the modern human brain; other legends believe the coffee tree is the "tree of knowledge" mentioned in the Genesis tale of the Garden of Eden.</p>
            <p>One of the first places that the practice of coffee growing and consumption spread first was Yemen in the Middle East, across the Red Sea from Ethiopia. From Yemen, it became widespread throughout the Middle East, in part because Islam prohibits alcohol, so coffee became one of the few allowable drugs that was widely available. The main port of Yemen was Mocha, which is where the term originated when used for a blend of coffee.</p>
            <p>Sufis, who practiced a mystical kind of Islam, were instrumental in spreading the practice of drinking coffee throughout the Islamic world. They may have known about caffeine from discovering tea during Islam's spread into China. Europeans during the Middle Ages knew little of coffee—some travelers and traders knew it as the "wine of Araby" and Crusaders also encountered it in the holy land, but it remained an exotic rarity for most Europeans, most of whom never got to try it.</p>

One important point of crossover was the Battle of Vienna in 1683, when the Ottoman Empire surrounded and nearly captured the city of Vienna but was defeated. During the siege, smugglers conducted business between the two armies, including bringing Turkish coffee into Vienna. After their defeat, the Ottoman troops retreated, leaving some of their coffee behind. To this day, Vienna is famous for its elegant and popular cafés.</p>
            <p>Portions of modern-day Hungary, including Budapest, were occupied by the Ottoman Empire for over a century and served as another point of contact and exchange, which brought coffee to the attention of Europeans.</p>

The coffeehouse was a place not only to drink coffee but also to read newspapers and pamphlets and discuss the revolutionary new ideas of the Enlightenment. Patrons, fueled by coffee, excitedly discussed new and revolutionary concepts and writings.</p>
            <p>European colonial powers realized the potential profits in the crop and began planting it in territories they had begun acquiring. Portugal planted it in Brazil in South America, which became (and remains) the biggest producer of coffee in the world; the Dutch planted it in Indonesia, especially in Java. Other plantations were set up in European colonies in Central America and the Caribbean (Belize, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Jamaica), South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru), and Africa (Rwanda, Tanzania).

            <p>Many spices that we know today, from cinnamon to black pepper, originated in tropical areas around the Indian Ocean, including especially the islands around Indonesia, Philippines, and New Guinea, which we often refer to as part of "Oceania." These spices were very rare and grew only in small areas—sometimes only on one small island.</p>
            <p>One cluster of islands, known as the Moluccas or Maluku islands, part of Indonesia today, were once also known as the "Spice Islands." Here, the rare spices cloves, nutmeg, and mace were native and could be found nowhere else—in part, because of the unique combination of volcanic soil and tropical climate there. Cloves, in fact, were so rare that they only grew on one tiny volcanic island.</p>
            <p>European food was quite bland in this period, with little in the way of flavoring beyond salt. As a result, any kind of flavorful spices were extremely desirable, and because they were so hard to come by, also extremely expensive. Anyone who could get ahold of some and bring them to Europe to sell could make enormous amounts of money. Many European explorers searched for the origins of these exotic spices—the Spice Islands.</p>

            <p>Opium is a powerful drug derived from the poppy plant. It has many effects, ranging from inducing sleepiness, suppressing coughs and killing pain, to inducing euphoria and dreamlike stupors.

            <p>In the late 1700s, Britain discovered another use for opium. Since the 1500s, Europeans had trouble finding anything they could sell to China that the Chinese wanted or would accept within their borders. As a result, there was a trade imbalance between Europe and China—Europe spent money (mostly silver) and China exported goods, especially silk and tea, which led to the depletion of currency reserves in Europe, and the huge stockpiling of currency in China.</p>
            <p>Opium became the one commodity that the British had and for which there was a large demand in China and in East Asia more broadly. Opium had already been known in China, and Europeans had introduced smoking tobacco in the 1500s to China as well, which helped pave the way for the practice of smoking opium in China, which made opium usage far more widespread in China than it had been in previous centuries. The British East India Company began producing opium in South Asia in the 1780s and selling it in China, despite a ban placed on the drug by the Chinese emperor.</p>

            <h3><span class="period-icon">19</span>1800s: The Opium Wars</h3>
            <p>By the 1800s, as Great Britain expanded its empire throughout South Asia, vast amounts of opium began to flow to Britain and to the rest of Europe as well. Having already discovered smoking as a social practice, Europeans realized that opium could be smoked as well, leading to much more intense effects. Opium dens—establishments where patrons could smoke the drug in comfort and seclusion—began to open in Europe. Poets and writers such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Dickens became opium addicts; even (First Lady) Mary Todd Lincoln was reportedly an addict.</p>
            <p>By the 1800s, Britain had become incredibly successful selling opium from India in China—sales of opium accounted for 25 percent of all the revenue of the British Empire. (At the same time, merchants from the United States began selling opium in China as well.)</p>
            <p>In 1839, in an attempt to stop the influx of illegal opium to China, the Chinese Qing dynasty seized and destroyed 20,000 chests of British opium, touching off a war between Britain and China known as the First Opium War, which Britain won decisively because of its technologically advanced military. A Second Opium War took place in 1858, which China lost just as badly; the result of this war was that China was forced to legalize opium production and consumption. After this point, opium became widespread in China, and China produced 85 percent of the world's opium.</p>
            <p>Opium spread with Chinese immigrants around the world, including to the United States. Morphine and heroin, both substances related to opium (i.e., opiates), began to be used as pain medication in Europe and the United States and were initially believed not to have the addictive potential of opium.</p>

            <h3><span class="period-icon">20</span>1900s–Present Day: Modern Addiction Crisis</h3>
            <p>By the 1900s, heroin had proven to be at least as addictive as opium, and its use became associated with nightlife in the United States. At the same time, with the growth of modern Chinese nationalism, opium became linked to the national disgrace and humiliation of the Opium Wars at the hands of the West. Once the communist leader Mao Zedong took power in China in 1949, opium production was eradicated, and to this day drug smuggling is considered a most serious offense in China, often punishable by death.</p>
            <p>Opium production did remain in Southeast Asia, where, in the form of heroin, it was frequently used by American servicemen during the Vietnam War, a result of which was that a flood of heroin found its way to American society in the 1960s and 1970s, causing a wave of drug addiction in the United States. By the 2000s, a new opiate addiction epidemic took hold in America, this time as a result of opiate pain pills such as oxycodone.</p>

It was known as a superior crop for many reasons: it grows in many different climates, including wet and dry, low and high altitudes, and in poor soil, where corn and wheat cannot grow. It has a short growing time, is easy to harvest, and very importantly, has a higher caloric value than many other crops.

In their conquest of the Incas, the Spanish discovered the potato and were the first to transport it back to Europe. There, they discovered its benefits, using it as a source of provisioning for their army as it marched from battle to battle across Europe during the 1500s. Everywhere they went, the potato was introduced, including Italy, Germany, France, and Holland.</p>

            <p>Because they kept for a long time, potatoes were also crucial to Europeans' long sea voyages which were necessary for them to establish their global empires during the 1700s and 1800s. As with other crops, Europeans spread the potato throughout their global empires. The British introduced potatoes to its colonies in South Asia, Africa, and Oceania in the 1800s.</p>
            <p>In 1845, a blight began in North America and spread to Europe, wiping out potato crops and causing devastating famine. When it spread to Ireland, however, it was particularly devastating. There, the potato blight lasted until 1851, during which time one million Irish died, and a million more emigrated, many to the United States. Many Americans with Irish heritage can trace their ancestry in part back to the potato famine. It is widely believed that British governmental policy exacerbated the effects of the famine by not importing emergency food supplies and actually exporting food out of Ireland during the famine. It became one of the main causes of the Irish independence movement over the next several decades.</p>

            <p>Silver has existed since prehistoric times in many parts of the world, including Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia, where it was used both for jewelry and crafts, and as coinage. One region in particular which valued silver was the Andes Mountains in South America, where the Inca and other cultures referred to silver as the "tears of the moon" and incorporated silver into many of their traditional crafts.</p>

            <p>Following the trail of Native silver, Spanish conquistadores in South America found the single largest deposit of silver in the world, in a place called Potosi in what is now Bolivia, in 1546. Using the enslaved labor of tens of thousands of Natives, including Incans, the Spanish built the largest silver mine in the world. It is estimated that tens of thousands of Native Americans died from exhaustion and accidents in that mine, possibly much more than that.</p>
            <p>Tens of thousands of African enslaved people were brought in to replace the Native Americans. The mines were operational from 1556 to 1783. Again, an unknown number of enslaved people continued to suffer and die in the mine, with one source estimating over a million deaths. During that period, over 40,000 metric tons of silver was shipped to Spain. As much as 40 percent of all goods shipped from the "New World" to Europe during the 1500s was just silver, almost all of it from the Potosi mine.</p>

            <h3><span class="period-icon">17</span>1600s: Spanish Power and Inflation</h3>
            <p>The wealth from the silver allowed Spain to equip a modern army and navy and ignite wars for conquest and power throughout Europe, including in Italy and the Netherlands, and eventually an attack on England by sea (known as the Spanish Armada), which was scuttled by bad weather. It was also used to purchase expensive new military technology that helped fuel the wars of the 1600s in Europe.</p>
            <p>It is believed that the large amount of silver that flowed into Europe through Spain also created a massive price inflation during the 1500s and 1600s in Europe and the Middle East. Eventually, the silver began to flow through Europe and the Middle East to China in East Asia in exchange for the many precious goods that Europeans could not acquire on their own, such as silk and porcelain. Some historians believe that the huge quantities of silver were crucial in jumpstarting the era of capitalism in Europe.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, much of this silver did not stay in Europe, but ended up in South Asia and East Asia during the 1600s and 1700s. In India, the silver was used by Europeans to purchase spices, such as pepper, and fine fabrics such as cotton, which was then used by Europeans to trade for enslaved people in West Africa. The silver helped enrich the Indian Mogul dynasty.</p>
            <p>In China, silver was the only thing Europeans had to offer in exchange for goods such as porcelain and silk, until the 1800s when they found they could also offer opium. In fact, most of the silver mined from Peru and Bolivia ended up in China, often in the form of stamped coins, which then served as a currency for the Ming dynasty. Often this silver bypassed Europe and was shipped on Spanish boats directly from South America across the Pacific to the Philippines, and from there to China. Over 30 million tons of silver ended up in China in this way.</p>

            <h3><span class="period-icon">PRE</span>Pre-1500s: South Asian Origins</h3>
            <p>Sugar comes from the sugarcane plant, which is a tall, reed-like plant from the grass family. When the reeds of the cane are crushed, sugary water can be extracted, and then boiled down to form pure crystalline sugar. Though it may have evolved first in Indonesia, it was first domesticated on a widespread basis in South Asia, where it was known as <em>khanda</em> (the source of the word candy) as well as <em>sarkara</em> (the source of the word sugar). Buddhists from India spread it to East Asia.</p>
            <p>Europeans had known about sugar since ancient times; the ancient Greeks discovered the substance in their travels to India and named the substance <em>saccharon</em> (the origin of the contemporary word saccharine), likely from the original Sanskrit name. Europeans in the Middle Ages referred to it as "sweet salt." As with spices from South Asia and Oceania, sugar was highly valued in Europe both because their diet was so bland and the only way to sweeten food came either from honey or from some root vegetables like beets. Also, like spices, "sweet salt" was very hard to come by, as it had to be imported from the Middle East, so it was very expensive, and anyone who could import it to Europe could make a lot of money.</p>

            <p>In the late 1400s and early 1500s, the Spanish and the Portuguese realized that sugar could be a lucrative crop. However, sugarcane needs heavy rainfall and a warm, tropical or semi-tropical climate to grow, and these conditions are not found anywhere in Spain or Portugal, or anywhere else in Europe. Thus, Spain and Portugal colonized islands in the Atlantic that do have tropical climates: Madeira and the Canary Islands. But processing sugarcane into raw sugar also requires a great amount of labor. So Spain and Portugal were the first to begin importing Black African enslaved people to work the cane in their Atlantic islands. From the beginning, therefore, sugarcane and the enslavement of Black Africans developed hand in hand.</p>
            <p>Christopher Columbus brought some sugarcane plants from the Canary Islands with him on his initial voyage of discovery and discovered that they grew extremely well in the Caribbean. Beginning early in the 1500s, Spanish encomenderos enslaved the surviving Native American population to work their sugarcane plantation in the Caribbean. When those Natives died out, Spanish, Portuguese, British, French, and Dutch colonial rulers began importing Black enslaved people from Africa by the millions to work on sugarcane plantations.</p>

            <p>All of this cruelty was driven by the ever-increasing demand, and purchasing power, in Europe for sugar. Beginning in the 1600s, desserts, which had been rare, now became commonplace, because of cheap sugar. Many of the finest European pastries and candies such as marzipan became accessible to the common citizen and working classes. In North America cheap sugar made desserts like pies and cookies part of the American culinary tradition. Sugar was combined with tea and coffee as well. It is hypothesized that the increase in calories in the European and American diets, especially among the working classes, led to fewer epidemics, more productivity, and longer lifespans.</p>

In the 1600s, it made its first appearance in England. Like coffee and chocolate, it was at first considered a medicinal drink in Europe, and very rare, consumed mainly by the upper classes and the wealthy bourgeoisie. Part of the difficulty was that, as with silk, Chinese producers of tea held a monopoly on the product, jealously guarding the seeds that could be used to spread the crop to other regions, and as a result tea remained very expensive.</p>

In Europe during the 1700s, tea was often consumed in coffeehouses, along with coffee, adding to the highly caffeinated environment of these establishments and contributing to the political fervor and revolutionary spirit that they produced.</p>

            <p>Tomatoes were first described by a Spanish Franciscan Friar, Bernardino Sahagún, in 1529, who encountered the fruit among Aztecs in Mexico in North America, who called them <em>xitomatl</em>, and were the first to combine them with hot peppers to make sauce, which they put on fish and other meats. Sahagún was probably the first to call them "tomates," likely a mistranslation of the Nahuatl word. During the 1500s, the Spanish spread cultivation of the tomato to the Caribbean.</p>
            <p>The first known mention of tomatoes in Europe is in Italy, where in 1543 an Italian herbalist named Pietro Matthioli described them as "golden apples"—reflecting their original yellow color and the fact that Europeans needed to understand new foods in terms of foods they already knew. (The Italian word for golden apple is <em>pomo d'oro</em>, "apples of gold." To this day, tomatoes are known as <em>pomidoros</em> in Italian.) In other places, tomatoes were known as "love apples." The first recorded instance of tomatoes being eaten in Italy was in 1548, when they were served to Cosimo de'Medici in Florence.</p>

            <p>Tomatoes took longer to be accepted widely in Europe, where it was believed for a long time that tomatoes were poisonous—especially in England. (This belief stemmed from the fact that tomatoes are part of the nightshade family of plants, which can be toxic.) So, for a while, they were only grown as ornamental plants. Other Europeans believed tomatoes to be medicinal in value and used them to treat a wide variety of ailments.</p>

            <p>It was also in the United States in the 1800s that tomatoes were first used to make ketchup, which had previously been a sauce which originated in East Asia, where it was made by combining tomatoes with pickled fish, and spread to England, where it was made using tomatoes and mushrooms. It was common to combine exotic spices such as nutmeg and mace in early recipes of tomato ketchup.

Thus, it was most often sailors crossing the Atlantic to and from the Caribbean who indulged in the practice of smoking tobacco. They often found it helped them to pass the time on long sea voyages, and from the very beginning they often remarked that smoking tobacco seemed highly addictive—even after their sea voyages were over, they still craved it.</p>
            <p>It became fashionable among Spanish aristocrats who smoked it or used it as snuff (snorted through the nose as a powder). Early British colonists in North America, especially in Virginia, were also among the first to encounter its use—it is believed that Sir Walter Raleigh was the first Englishman to bring tobacco back to Britain, introducing it to Queen Elizabeth in the mid-1500s. Many European doctors also believed it to have great medicinal value and recommended smoking tobacco for a wide range of health problems.</p>

From 1625 to 1675, European consumption of tobacco rose from 20,000 pounds per year to 20 million pounds per year. It was often consumed in cafes along with coffee, chocolate, and tea, and became a favorite practice of the European bourgeoisie—one theory holds that this was related to the increasing number of Europeans who were engaged in nonmanual labor.</p>
            <p>In the 1600s, European sailors also spread it to Africa, where tobacco was one of the goods traded for enslaved people, and where it replaced traditional stimulants like betel leaves. It also spread quickly through the Middle East, where it was at first believed to have medicinal properties—although the Ottoman Sultan banned it for a time after doctors began to realize its harmful qualities.</p>
            <p>The North American colonies of Virginia and North Carolina, in particular, proved to have climates very well suited for growing tobacco, and in the 1600s it quickly became the most important crop for colonists to be able to sell at a profit, largely due to the burgeoning worldwide demand for it.
