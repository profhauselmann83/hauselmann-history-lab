        <h2>3: &ldquo;The Other Reformation&rdquo;: Martin Luther, Religious Dogma and the Common People</h2>
        
        <p>Before the official Reformation that we read about in textbooks, there was Jan Hus of Bohemia, a precursor to all the changes of the sixteenth century. Hus became active in the fifteenth century. As a professor at Prague University, Hus made a critique of the Catholic Church that was in many ways deeper and more biting than that of Luther a century later. Despite widespread support, Hus made the fatal mistake of believing the clerical establishment would honor the immunity granted him to attend a Church council. Instead of the theological debate he had been expecting, Hus was tried for heresy, condemned and burned at the stake in the summer of 1415. Far from ending the matter, the Roman Catholic Church thereby unwittingly unleashed a wave of rebellion that lasted into the 1430s and spread from Bohemia into Poland.</p>
<p>The Hussite movement, as it is generally called, ranged from moderates who would have been comfortable as Lutheran reformers in a later century (Luther had not yet been born) to the radical Taborites (named after the Bohemian town of T&aacute;bor). The latter can be seen as Christian communists who sought to establish a Christian community where all goods would be shared in common. A Bohemian translation of the Bible had existed since 1630; this translation allowed radical clerics and educated laity to see for themselves contradictions between the original teachings of Christ and established Church practice. As one nineteenth-century critic suggested:</p>
<p><blockquote>As soon as the populace could read the Bible in their own language (the Roman Catholic priesthood understood well why they wished to make the knowledge of this book their own privilege), they did not draw from the New Testament its lessons of humility and self-denial, but those of hatred to the rich.<sup><span class="s1">1</span></sup></blockquote></p>
<p class="page-num">18</p>
<p>After the murder of Hus, those called Taborites proceeded to set up their ideal society. Their rules included:</p>
<p><blockquote>&hellip;there shall be no king, ruler or subject on the earth, and all imposts and taxes shall cease; no one shall force another to do anything, for all shall be equal brothers and sisters...there is no mine or thine, but all is held in common to all, and no one own anything for himself alone. Whoever does so commits a deadly sin.<sup><span class="s1">2</span></sup></blockquote></p>
<p>Even an enemy of these radicals admitted the importance they placed on education, including the training of women. The hostile witness additionally conceded that among the Taborites &ldquo;you will find hardly one young woman who is not versed in both the Old and New Testaments.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">3</span></sup> It has also been said that a great many of these radicals were wool-weavers, rather than there being only peasants taking part.<sup><span class="s1">4</span></sup> It is important to note that these rebels were not unwilling to fight. They, like radicals after them, looked to Christ&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword,&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">5</span></sup> and found legitimation in their right to use physical force&mdash;that is, legitimation of physical force for, at the very least, self-defense.</p>
<p>In any event, most agree that there was little in the way of long-term prospects for these radicals. The movement was effectively crushed on May 30, 1434 when an army led by nobles slaughtered 13,000 out of 18,000 armed Taborite soldiers. Defeat in one manner or the other was most likely inevitable. Well over a century ago, Karl Kautsky argued that the &ldquo;needs of the poor engendered the struggle for communism, those of production demanded the existence of private proprietorship. Hence communism could never become the universal form of society in those days.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">6</span></sup> This may be a bit dogmatic but it may well be largely true.</p>
<p>A more commonly told story of the Reformation is the tale of piousindividuals reacting to the misguided if not venial practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Pride of place is often given to a German monk, Martin Luther, who ignited the movement by nailing 95 theses onto a Wittenberg church door in 1517. In and of itself, this was not necessarily a grave matter as this was the accepted manner to call for a theological debate. Luther did not, however, ask for a debate over mere details of the faith. He wished to strike at the heart of Church practice, most notably the selling of indulgences that allowed the common people to pay a fee to Rome in return for the forgiveness of sin, which would reduce the time that their souls would spend in purgatory. Since everyone was said to have sinned, even</p>
<p class="page-num">19</p>
<p>the most clean-living person could expect thousands of years in purgatory where the soul would be painfully purified. To many people, indulgences appeared a good deal.</p>
<p>Martin Luther did not think it was a good deal at all. He quickly began to promote the idea that not only indulgences but also any such practices or beliefs not found in the Bible were useless in the quest for salvation. The former monk who had become a professor of theology argued for <em>sola </em><em>scriptura</em>: that only the Bible was a guide to Christian faith and practice. No longer would papal pronouncements or the decisions of Church councils matter. As his oppositional ideas began to come together into a new theology, Martin Luther came to insist that salvation could come only through Christ and faith in his grace.<sup><span class="s1">7</span></sup> He was not quibbling about the finer nuances of theology; Luther was interrogating the established faith of Western Europe.</p>
<p>Another Protestant leader, John Calvin, believed the Holy Spirit draws people towards Christ. Originally from France, Calvin established a theocracy in Geneva, Switzerland. Believing that Church and State should be one, the establishment of theocratic government was completely consistent with his thoughts.<sup><span class="s1">8</span></sup> Not to be forgotten was Huldreich Zwingli who, like Martin Luther, vigorously fought against the sale of indulgences as early as 1518. And then there was Henry VIII of England, who Protestants sometimes argue did the right thing for the wrong reason. Unable to convince the pope to allow him to set aside his wife and take another in hopes of fathering a legitimate male heir, Henry broke from Rome in 1533. The list of prominent figures in the Reformation could go on for some time but our main points lie elsewhere.</p>
<p>Entire forests have been leveled to produce the paper needed to recount the story above, in vast and often bewildering detail. What these mountains of books, articles and essays often overlook is that the Reformation was a process, not an event. Most importantly, it was far more than an argument over who got to drink wine at Sunday mass or other aspects of Christian praxis/practice and liturgy. Many issues, even interpretations of history, were in dispute.<sup><span class="s1">9</span></sup> Long before Luther nailed to that church door what would prove to be, unknown to Luther at the time, a declaration of war against papal authority, there were others who challenged medieval Christian practices and dogma. In the fourteenth century, John Wycliffe attacked Rome in terms highly suggestive of the later Martin Luther. Wycliffe railed against Church corruption, which included the sale of indulgences and the veneration of saints, not to mention the appalling ignorance and low moral standards of the clergy. Likewise, Jan Hus fought along the same line of</p>
<p class="page-num">20</p>
<p>thought as Wycliffe and even translated the latter&rsquo;s writings into the tongue of his native Bohemia. As we know, the Roman Catholic Church burnt Hus in 1415 for the trouble he incited. In this he followed in a long line of Church suppression, as witnessed in the case of the Cathars.</p>
<p>The point is that, while theologians may have seen their opposition to the Roman Catholic Church establishment mainly as matters of faith, the common people often interpreted religious dissent as a call to reject the established order&mdash;both lay and clerical. Any call to resist papal exploitation, such as church taxes, quickly led people to question secular oppression. If the Church had strayed from the teachings of Christ, should not Christians live as the Son of God in the same manner his disciples had? If, as Jesus said, &ldquo;It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God,&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">10</span></sup> how should we think of the nobility? And, if Christ is the model, why not share everything as had been the practice of Jesus and the early believers. When commoners learned from readings from Acts of the Apostles the manner of Christian life in past times, some found inspiration to reject the feudal order. Imagine a European peasant hearing for the first time that Christians had held &ldquo;all things in common,&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">11</span></sup> and any surplus was &ldquo;distributed to each as anyone had need.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">12</span></sup> Since Christianity pervaded European language and culture at that time, the rebellion, too, would be phrased in Biblical tones even if, for some, the motivation may have been a bit more secular. At this time, commoners were shielded from the texts both as a deliberate move by Rome, which stated only clergy could interpret and dispense this knowledge, coupled with illiteracy and lack of access to books.</p>
<p>An important difference between Jan Hus&rsquo;s time and Luther&rsquo;s was the development of the printing press and the increase in literacy. One estimate suggests that male literacy was less than 10 percent at the start of the sixteenth century but rose to around 50 percent by the century&rsquo;s end.<sup><span class="s1">13 </span></sup>Regardless of the actual literacy rate (a subject open to debate and interpretation), it is certain that there was an explosive spread of knowledge and ideas following the development of printing in Western Europe. This new information technology doubtlessly spurred on the Reformation. With it, Martin Luther became a best-selling author who sold over 300,000 copies of his works in the three years following 1517. Even in the media-saturated world of the twenty-first century, that is impressive. No wonder Luther proclaimed the printing press as an example of God&rsquo;s grace.<sup><span class="s1">14</span></sup> It was the printing press, as much as brilliant theology, which made the Reformation popular among much of the population. As the dissemination of books and information became more common and affordable, people learned of new</p>
<p class="page-num">21</p>
<p>scriptures and doctrines. Numerous attacks on established Christianity took place in various parts of Western Europe throughout feudalism. Despite the viciousness of the Church assault on heresy, is it reasonable to assume a total victory of the entrenched clerical order over the dissenters? One scholar who has studied this issue at length noted: &ldquo;It is rather hard to believe that heresies, which had secretly lived on in certain towns and villages for one or two hundred years should suddenly have died out by 1500.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">15</span></sup> In fact, there exists overwhelming documentation to support the idea that various heresies survived until the Reformation and beyond.<sup><span class="s1">16 </span></sup></p>
<p>It may well be that profound discontent with rulers, both lay and clerical, was widespread in at least some parts of Europe before the Reformation per se began. Common people were often less than satisfied with their lot in feudal society, yet revolts and rebellions were but the most dramatic manifestation. Unlike Jan Hus and those who followed his teachings, Luther, Calvin and many others were successful in breaking from Rome largely because they had gained the protection of local rulers and regional elites. In rejecting the Roman Catholic Church, they did not necessarily denounce the idea of a hierarchical society. Some even quipped that Lutheranism was Roman Catholicism without the Pope, but with a handful of tweaks to traditional practice. While this is too simplistic a judgment, it is true the religious reform largely stopped at the castle gates. That is, religious reform was on the European agenda in the sixteenth century, social revolution was not: nor, even, was serious reform. Whether founded by Luther, the man the Pope famously called &ldquo;that little drunken monk,&rdquo; or Henry VIII of England, the new Churches were to be as supportive of secular authority as the Roman Church had ever been.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the most dramatic, and bloody, confrontation between the conservative and radical theories of the Reformation took place in central Europe...in the German states.<sup><span class="s1">17</span></sup> It is known to history as the German Peasant War of 1525. According to most estimates, this popular rebellion was the largest and most widespread until at least the English Revolution of the 1640s, if not the French Revolution of 1789. Although Engels&rsquo;s early work on the Peasant War<sup><span class="s1">18</span></sup> has led the topic to be a favorite of Marxist historians, key points like the doctrine of the community of goods and the life of the common people have now been acknowledged by non-Marxist historians as well.<sup><span class="s1">19</span></sup> If the name of Martin Luther is tied forever to the Reformation, Thomas M&uuml;ntzer<sup><span class="s1">20</span></sup> was the spiritual leader of those who rejected not only papal exploitation but secular oppression as well. </p>
<p>M&uuml;ntzer<sup><span class="s1">21</span></sup> was a highly educated priest, who was attracted to the ideas of Luther in 1518. By the following year, he was preaching against the</p>
<p class="page-num">22</p>
<p>Church&rsquo;s veneration of saints and the papal hierarchy. Serving as a pastor at Zwickau, Saxony, which was well-known as a town where clear conflict existed between miners and the upper class. M&uuml;ntzer quickly sided with miners against the upper class. As time went on, he became convinced not only of his opposition to the Roman Catholic hierarchy but to Luther&rsquo;s reformist program. Chased from Zwickau in 1521, he traveled to Bohemia to gain the support of the remaining Taborites who had been inspired by Jan Hus. By the following year, he recognized his total opposition to Luther and his followers. His theology took on an increasingly revolutionary tone as he came to believe that the common people were the true instruments of God. M&uuml;ntzer turned on Luther, who he referred to as &ldquo;Dr. Liar.&rdquo; He was convinced that Luther was the mouthpiece for the rich and powerful. As M&uuml;ntzer wrote in his Sermon to the Princes: &ldquo;It is thanks to the German nobility whose snouts you have petted and given honey, that you stood before the Holy Roman Empire at Worms...the devil should devour you...Your flesh is like that of an ass, and you would have to be cooked slowly.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">22</span></sup></p>
<p>As time went on, the theological emphasis of M&uuml;ntzers&rsquo; work appears to have taken a back seat to his more secular demands. In any case, the peasants put forth demands that were certainly not obscure discussions on the nature of salvation. In March 1525, a collection of German-speaking commoners agreed upon Twelve Articles, which had a press run of over 25,000 copies within two months.<sup><span class="s1">23</span></sup> These demands included the redirection of the higher than 10 percent tithe for public purposes, allowing only a reasonable subtraction for a pastor&rsquo;s living. Among the other demands were the abolition of serfdom, restoration of fishing and hunting rights, and restrictions on taxes, rents and forced labor, as well as an end to all arbitrary justice and administration.<sup><span class="s1">24</span></sup></p>
<p>Whether this rebellion was religiously motivated or caused by economic oppression has been a matter of intense debate. It is probably fair to argue it was the latter dressed up in the theological clothes of the former. Of course, for the average sixteenth-century German, the idea of some separation between religion and everyday life might well have seemed puzzling. This was a popular, if ultimately failed, revolution that included the participation of women.<sup><span class="s1">25</span></sup> The established powers took great alarm at a movement that may have involved as many as 300,000 people; the anti-peasant response was brutal repression. The commoners lacked artillery and cavalry, not to mention military experience. Many rebels were pacifists in their belief and unwilling to fight. As Conrad Grebel wrote to Thomas M&uuml;ntzer in 1524, many followers would not &ldquo;use worldly sword or war, since all killing has</p>
<p class="page-num">23</p>
<p>ceased with them.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">26</span></sup> Further, the democratic nature of the movement may have been ill-suited to the demands for all-out class war.</p>
<p>This did not prevent Martin Luther from urging on the peasants&rsquo; assassins to ever greater violence. Rather than searching for a negotiated settlement that would spare the blood of the commoners, Luther egged on the upper-class military forces to show no mercy whatsoever. His words are as vile and as much an incitement to murder as those he wrote against his Jewish neighbors.<sup><span class="s1">27</span></sup> Even Christian peasants, who sought to change the secular world, were beyond any hope of mercy in Luther&rsquo;s mind. So Luther urged the knights to &ldquo;Stab, smite, slay whoever can. If you die in doing it, well for you! A more blessed death can never be yours...[as this killing] pleases God; this I know.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">28</span></sup> By the time the military had finished their task of restoring order on behalf of the rulers, there were an estimated 100,000 German commoners slain.<sup><span class="s1">29</span></sup> Proportionate to the population of Germany today, this would equate to over a million victims; it was a holocaust of the German peasantry if you will.</p>
<p>Nor did matters end there. It is important to understand the price paid by the German peasants for their failed rebellion not only in terms of lives lost, but also the economic impact on the survivors. The rulers, who ultimately suppressed the uprising, had been desperate to raise huge sums to pay the needed mercenary armies. Lacking sufficient cash reserves, short-term loans were asked or demanded to cover the immediate cost of the anti-peasant war. Loans were slow in coming and the contribution extracted by force from various urban Jewish communities was not enough to fund the slaughter.<sup><span class="s1">30</span></sup> Later, to cover the cost of these loans, reparations payments were demanded from those areas that had risen in revolt.<sup><span class="s1">31 </span></sup>Ultimately, the pressure applied to the peasantry resulted in the collection of approximately twice the actual cost of the war.<sup><span class="s1">32</span></sup> As one author commented, &ldquo;The costs of the campaign of suppression were borne largely by the rebels themselves...The struggle which had begun with the call for recognition of the social, political, and economic rights of the peasants ended in their deeper subjection.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">33</span></sup></p>
<p>With this massive repression, the rulers were able to suppress the radical or left wing of the Reformation, that is, those who wished to change secular society and rulers not just the people&rsquo;s relationship with the Church. An unknown number of Europeans continued to insist on changes more drastic than those allowed by Luther. History has lumped all these dissenters under the label &ldquo;Anabaptist.&rdquo; This, like all strict descriptions of early Protestantism, suffers from oversimplification.<sup><span class="s1">34</span></sup> It is also important to note that those given the title Anabaptist seldom, if ever, accepted the label. They</p>
<p class="page-num">24</p>
<p>normally preferred to simply call themselves Christians.<sup><span class="s1">35</span></sup> Luther&rsquo;s hostility towards them is well known and documented, but that of John Calvin is often overlooked.</p>
<p>Calvin, an urban (or bourgeois) Frenchman, possessed the worldview of the rising so-called &ldquo;middle classes.&rdquo; A former theology student at the University of Paris who later dabbled in the study of law, John Calvin provided a justification for the increasing independence of the new developing urban business class from their feudal rulers. Unsurprisingly, Calvin&rsquo;s theology, with its limited tolerance for feudal political authority and an emphasis on the work ethic, fit nicely with the needs and desires of the untitled well-off and other city dwellers. Calvin&rsquo;s thought provided a religious argument against those radical Protestant ideas that might justify discontent, or even revolt, among the masses. If there is any doubt about his anti-populist attitudes, it is only necessary to consult Calvin&rsquo;s published works. He wrote bitterly against M&uuml;ntzer and all who followed radical teachings, whom he lumped together as Anabaptists.<sup><span class="s1">36</span></sup></p>
<p>Why such vigor in attacking the Anabaptists when the Roman Catholic Church remained the most powerful religious organization in Europe? Of course, that fundamental differences in theology played a part is clear, but far from the whole story. Correctly or not, those they called Anabaptists were seen as the seed of the 1525 German Peasant Revolt and as such, a threat to established order&mdash;be it Catholic, Lutheran, or Calvinist. Luther and Calvin were both in the process of carving out zones of power and influence outside the writ of the Roman Catholic Church. This took place with the blessing of many local nobles and the wealthy&mdash;neither man was anxious to bite the hand that fed them by appearing to be soft on those seen as rebels against property and position. The Anabaptists were perceived as a potential enemy to the ordered world as envisioned, albeit in different ways by the Pope, Luther, and Calvin alike.<sup><span class="s1">37</span></sup> In some cases, theological concerns appear to have taken second place to economic distress. </p>
<p>In 1515, Pope Leo X sent a papal legate to Scandinavia to collect money to pay for work on St. Peter&rsquo;s Church in Rome. His mission was quite fruitful, as he raised more than a million florins from Sweden and Denmark. It is held by many that this planted the idea of the Reformation in many northern European minds. After a series of bloody repressions supported by papal authority, Gustavas Vasa, son of a murdered Swedish senator, raised an army of commoners and defeated the pro-papal forces led by King Christian II of Denmark. Vasa became king of Sweden in 1523 and Christian II lost his throne in Denmark. King Vasa had become a supporter of Lutheran beliefs and systematically worked to destroy papal power in</p>
<p class="page-num">25</p>
<p>northern Europe. Whatever sincere conflicts of conscience the Swedish monarchy had with the Roman Catholic Church, there was also the reality of the Church as a massive property holder. For reasons that may have mixed together nationalism against a distant power (Rome) and perhaps simple lust for wealth and power, Church power and property was targeted in Sweden. As the Church had more wealth within its kingdom than did the monarch and other nobles combined, Vasa proceeded to tax ecclesiastical property, and as many as 20,000 estates, houses and farms were seized and given to lay ownership.<sup><span class="s1">38</span></sup> It is widely considered that the Reformation in Sweden was consolidated by 1529. Denmark was to remain outside the circle of Lutheranism, but had forever broken from Rome by 1547.</p>
<p>As stressed before, women played a vital role in the Reformation.<sup><span class="s1">39</span></sup> This does not, however, mean that the Reformation was always and everywhere an advance for women&rsquo;s rights. In a careful examination of the Norwegian Reformation, the traditional view is that the situation of women may have actually deteriorated. Women&rsquo;s rights and participation in these movements specifically varied considerably across location and time, and class concerns were an aspect of commonality. Men like Luther and Calvin were successful because of their message&mdash;protection of the powerful&mdash;but also because many commoners saw them as attacking systems of privilege that had long exploited the people. In short, where the people were unhappy about their position in society they tended to back Protestants whereas those areas where the Church was seen more as an employer, provider of welfare to the poor and sick, and promoter of trade typically remained loyal to Rome.</p>
<p>Even Henry VIII would have been loath to move so boldly against the Roman Church if it had had massive popular support in England. Yet, the impulses that led to attack on the Roman Church were strong throughout most of Western Europe. Consider that these impulses were evident even in places little mentioned as areas of Reformation support such as Hungary,<sup><span class="s1">40 </span></sup>Poland<sup><span class="s1">41</span></sup> and even Spain.<sup><span class="s1">42</span></sup> Of course, the long-term significance of some of these movements can certainly be questioned, as the Church was able to weather the popular storms by rallying their supporters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in England, under the Tudor monarchs, there unfolded a type of Reformation from above. The story of Henry VIII breaking from Rome in his desire to secure a divorce from Catherine of Aragon in the hope of fathering a legitimate male heir with another woman is well known. Therefore, we need not recount the details here. Of more interest is the fact that Henry was positively hostile when Luther first raised the banner of rebellion against the papacy. His attack on Lutheranism was so fierce that Pope Leo X was moved to award the English king with the title</p>
<p class="page-num">26</p>
<p>&ldquo;Defender of the Faith.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">43</span></sup> Even after the break from the Roman Catholic Church, Henry and later his daughter Queen Elizabeth I always maintained that they remained Catholics and rejected, by and large, the teachings of Luther, Calvin and other Protestant theologians. Many historians argue that Henry VIII&rsquo;s break from centuries of religious obedience was at base political not theological. The king was quite careful about not falling into what he considered heresy. Henry steered a middle way between Rome and Luther or Calvin and the Pope.</p>
<p>So, what did the average person make of Henry and the break from Rome, the dissolution of the religious houses and the (minor) changes in Christian ritual? Although this question, like so much about the Tudors, remains a subject of much debate, it appears that overall, commoners saw little to complain about. Many, perhaps most, had seen the Church as corrupt and they resented the mandatory payments for sacraments and arbitrary clerical authority, and envied the vast land holdings of the religious orders. When the Crown confiscated Church wealth, most people were indifferent, if not supportive.<sup><span class="s1">44</span></sup> Soon, there arose a new class of men who would directly profit by purchasing Church holdings from King Henry. By participating in what Rome called &ldquo;the rape of Mother Church,&rdquo; these people would tie themselves to the fortunes of the Tudor project. A later restoration of papal authority threatened not merely religious reform but the new landowners&rsquo; very economic wealth.<sup><span class="s1">45</span></sup> After Henry, Christianity in England would be based on neither papal nor biblical authority&mdash;instead, power would lay with the will of the sovereign.<sup><span class="s1">46</span></sup></p>
<p>The upheaval caused by the Reformation led to increased possibilities, or what might even be considered freedoms, for common Europeans. At the same time, the shock waves of social change threatened those of the established order who often looked for a scapegoat. The most frequent victims of what has become known as the &ldquo;Burning Times&rdquo; of the sixteenth century were Jews, Muslims and largely women accused of being witches. With the former two groups, the element of racial and religious bigotry is pretty apparent.<sup><span class="s1">47</span></sup> The situation as regards witches needs further investigation. Witches, the vast majority of whom were independent women, were executed in huge numbers.<sup><span class="s1">48</span></sup> Rather than a local or minor problem, evidence suggests that this was a type of &ldquo;gender cleansing&rdquo; of free-spirited women in Reformation Europe.<sup><span class="s1">49</span></sup> The most notable text used by Catholic authorities (not to suggest that Protestants did not equally engage in witch-hunts) was <em>Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammer of Witches)</em> published by the Catholic Inquisition in 1485&ndash;86. Finding that women were inclined by their very nature toward Satan, much like Jews and Muslims, this book</p>
<p class="page-num">27</p>
<p>provided the moral and theological justification &ldquo;for a horrible, endless march of suffering, torture, and human disgrace inflicted on thousands of women.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">50</span></sup></p>
<p>Despite the fact that witch-hunts took place from the fourteenth through seventeenth century, it is important to note that the period between 1570 and 1630 was the most significant, intense and vicious phase. During these sixty years, around 80 percent of the accused were female. Most usually, the arrested were not only women but also poor, elderly, unmarried, widows and, what one scholar termed, the &ldquo;vagabonds of the rural or urban working class.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">51</span></sup> There were social considerations as well, since the unrest sweeping Europe had allowed some women to achieve a level of independence that frightened male authorities. This all took place in the context of crisis: feudalism was in decline; the Roman Catholic Church was traumatized by the Reformation, and strong states and monarchies had emerged, as well as an ever more powerful bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>A profusion of crises came about, particularly after the Reformation, to establish a cultural climate of fear. In this atmosphere, witch-hunts flourished since &ldquo;the devil could be blamed for these woes, it remained merely to identify his human agents...&lsquo;cunning women,&rsquo; midwives and healers became easy targets.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">52</span></sup> Interestingly, these assaults on the common people, and women in particular, were not the exclusive domain of Rome, the Pope, or the Holy Inquisition. While the Catholic authorities arrested, condemned and burned Protestants as witches, Protestants eagerly returned the favor and did the same to Catholics. Meanwhile, both were happy to kill members of their own faith if the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; demanded it. Lutherans joined Calvinists in persecuting the Anabaptists and everyone scapegoated the Jews and Muslims. The connection between the witch paranoia and the Reformation has been established. The brunt of the repression, as so often was the case, fell heavily on women, especially those who refused conventional female roles.<sup><span class="s1">53</span></sup></p>
<p>Though often portrayed by historians as passive or even hapless, women were neither. Evidence suggests that assertive women were not isolated exceptions. When women gathered as a social group or community, they posed a perceived threat to the authorities. This was particularly true when these female communities were based in guidance and support for one another on personal and domestic matters. According to records of the Inquisition, Spanish women &ldquo;shared information about sexual practices among themselves and relied on each other for advice and guidance in intimate matters.&rdquo;<sup><span class="s1">54</span></sup> In England, many men and not a few women were executed for allegedly committing acts of sodomy.<sup><span class="s1">55</span></sup> Notably, sexuality,</p>
<p class="page-num">28</p>
<p>particularly homosexuality, became linked to heresy and ultimately witchcraft.<sup><span class="s1">56</span></sup> After all, such charges were easy to put forth and difficult to defend against, making them a useful form of social control over women and the lower classes. In other words, those rebels who may have failed to keep their heads down often found themselves executed for crimes, real or invented, other than those that drew the attention of the authorities.</p>
<p>It can be argued that the same social and economic forces that facilitated the Reformation helped give rise to witch-hunts. If the printing press and strong states willing to defy the papacy made the Reformation a success, they also intensified attacks against the commoners. By 1550, the ruling classes</p>
<p><blockquote>&hellip; possessed the technological and administrative means of Christianizing the European peasantry. Carrying uniformly printed Bibles and catechisms and backed by the armed might of centralized principalities, post-Reformation clergy everywhere set out to suppress all unorthodox belief and behaviour.<sup><span class="s1">57</span></sup></blockquote></p>
<p>Therefore, although the Reformation may have freed a portion of Europeans from the exploitation of Rome, it suppressed any attempt to move beyond the limits decreed by Luther, Calvin, or their sponsors. Those who sought to expand the freedom from Rome to a society of justice and equality were crushed without a trace of Christian mercy. The vision of a world where all would be bound by ties of solidarity and freedom was everywhere drowned in blood. Whether Christian communists inspired by Hus or M&uuml;ntzer, or &ldquo;cunning&rdquo; women branded as witches, or simply people who worshipped differently such as Jews and Muslims, the rulers proposed but one choice: submit or perish. The victims came from varying backgrounds, and may have had even conflicting beliefs and practices from one another, but in the end they all posed a threat to Rome and endured much of the same persecution and punishment.</p>
