                    <p>Edmund Burke (1729–1797) was a noted political theorist and long-serving member of Parliament during the latter half of the eighteenth century. He represented the town of Bristol from 1774 to 1780. On November 3, 1774, he delivered a campaign speech to the 5,000 electors of Bristol, explaining his understanding of the duties of an elected official.</p>
                    <p><strong>THOUGHT QUESTION:</strong> If you would not want your neighbors performing surgery on your heart or installing the plumbing in your house, why do you want their ill-considered opinions reflected in the laws you have to obey?</p>

                    <p>Certainly, gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention.</p>

                    <p><strong>But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living.</strong> These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable.

                    <p><strong>The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are:</strong> first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.</p>

                    <p><strong>The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country.</strong> Under such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves.</p>

                            <p>In the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the republic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number, in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried.</p>

                    <p><strong>The idea of an actual representation of all classes of the people, by persons of each class, is altogether visionary.</strong> Mechanics and manufacturers will always be inclined, with few exceptions, to give their votes to merchants, in preference to persons of their own professions or trades. <strong>They know that the merchant is their natural patron and friend.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>A fair and equal representation is that in which the interests, feelings, opinions and views of the people are collected, in such manner as they would be were the people all assembled.</strong></p>

                    <p>However, if the representation be so formed as to give one or more of the natural classes of men in the society an undue ascendency over the others, it is imperfect; the former will gradually become masters, and the latter slaves. <strong>It is the first of all among the political balances, to preserve in its proper station each of these classes.</strong></p>

                            <p>Since I advanced the idea of balancing the several orders of men in a community, I have been sensibly struck with a sentence in the marquis Beccaria's treatise: <strong>"In every society there is an effort continually tending to confer on one part the height of power and happiness, and to reduce the others to the extreme of weakness and misery; the intent of good laws is to oppose this effort."</strong></p>
                        </div>
                    </details>

                    <p><strong>In my idea of our natural aristocracy in the United States, I include about four or five thousand men</strong>; and among these I reckon those who have been placed in the offices of governors, of members of Congress, and state senators generally.</p>

                    <p>The other persons and orders in the community form the natural democracy; this includes in general the yeomanry, the subordinate officers, civil and military, the fishermen, mechanics and traders, many of the merchants and professional men.</p>

                    <p><strong>It is easy to perceive that men of these two classes, the aristocratical, and democratical, with views equally honest, have sentiments widely different, especially respecting public and private expences, salaries, taxes, &c.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>A small representation can never be well informed as to the circumstances of the people</strong>, the members of it must be too far removed from the people, in general, to sympathize with them.</p>

                    <hr class="dp-hr-shapes" />
                    <h3><strong>FROM LETTER 9</strong></h3>

                    <p>When we call on thirty or forty thousand inhabitants to unite in giving their votes for one man, it will be uniformly impracticable for them to unite in any men, except those few who have become eminent for their civil or military rank, or their popular legal abilities.</p>

                    <p>It is obvious, that for an assembly to be a true likeness of the people of any country, they must be considerably numerous.—One man, or a few men, cannot possibly represent the feelings, opinions, and characters of a great multitude.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mr. G. LIVINGSTON [Federalist]:</strong> Proposes amendment: "Resolved, That no person shall be eligible as a senator for more than six years in any term of twelve years, and that it shall be in the power of the legislatures of the several states to recall their senators."</p>

                    <p><strong>Mr. SMITH [Antifederalist]:</strong> As the clause now stands, there is no doubt that senators will hold their office perpetually. <strong>Senators are agents of their states.</strong> When a state sends an agent commissioned to transact any business, it certainly ought to have a power to recall.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mr. HAMILTON [Federalist]:</strong> <strong>Senators are agents for the Union, trustees of the common good.</strong> He is an agent for the Union, and he is bound to perform services necessary to the good of the whole, though his state should condemn them.</p>

                    <p><strong>The struggle over the Constitution can best be understood as a social one. The quarrel was fundamentally one between aristocracy and democracy.</strong></p>

                    <p>The different lives led by the talented, the wealthy, and the powerful few—called the "natural aristocracy," in contrast to the conventional aristocracy of titled nobles—made them unsuitable representatives of ordinary people.</p>

                            <p>In these repeated attacks on deference and the capacity of a conspicuous few to speak for the whole society, the Antifederalists struck at the roots of the traditional conception of political society.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Antifederalists were destroying the great chain of being, thus undermining the social basis of republicanism and shattering that unity and harmony of social and political authority which the eighteenth century generally had considered essential to the maintenance of order.</p>

                    </details>

                    <p><strong>The secret to securing representatives attentive to the common good is to have them elected by the whole community, or to enlarge the size of electoral districts while reducing the size of the legislative body.</strong></p>

                    <p>The federal government would act as a kind of sieve, extracting <strong>"from the mass of the society the purest and noblest characters which it contains."</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>The Constitution was intrinsically an aristocratic document designed to check the democratic tendencies of the period, and as such it dictated the character of the Antifederalist response.</strong></p>

                            <p>Through the artificial contrivance of the Constitution overlying an expanded society, the Federalists meant to restore and to prolong the traditional kind of elitist influence in politics that social developments, especially since the Revolution, were undermining.</p>
                            
                            <p>The result was an amazing display of confidence in constitutionalism. <strong>Thus the Federalists did not directly reject democratic politics as it had manifested itself in the 1780's; rather they attempted to adjust to this politics in order to control and mitigate its effects. In short they offered the country an elitist theory of democracy.</strong></p>
