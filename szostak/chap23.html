        <p><strong>Relationship to other chapters:</strong> Chapter 23 follows most obviously from chapter 18 in its discussion of transport. We have devoted attention throughout this book to expanded trade links and information flows, for these serve to connect the regions of the world. The dramatic change in this period involves a reduction of both travel times and costs with the introduction of railways and steamships (and new canals and bridges). These advances are best understood in comparison with preceding transport technology and infrastructure. We have traced political developments through many preceding chapters; for the nineteenth century, we address two critical transformations: colonization in this chapter and revolution in chapter 25. Colonization will exert important influences on both colonizers and colonized in later chapters; we will return most explicitly to the causes and effects of colonization when we discuss decolonization in chapter 30. We can best appreciate the dramatic change in speed of scientific discovery and its impact on the wider world by comparing nineteenth-century science to the science of earlier centuries. Likewise, we can best appreciate unprecedented increases in agricultural productivity comparatively. Transport times continue to drop and agricultural productivity continues to rise in the twentieth century; we thus resume discussion of these trends, and their effects, in later chapters. Our discussion of working and middle classes suggests that something qualitatively new emerges during this period; this new world can be contrasted to earlier societies characterized by a large peasantry, small elite, and much lower proportions of workers or merchants or managers. These new classes remain important in the twentieth century: They encourage political, cultural, and social changes that many later chapters address.</p>

        <p>Historians have long spoken of a "long nineteenth century" stretching from the American and French Revolutions of the late eighteenth century to World War I in the twentieth century. Such a characterization is a little bit Eurocentric. Within Europe, the period from the end of the Napoleonic Wars to World War I is mostly peaceful: The wars associated with the unification of Germany and Italy (chapter 21) were far less severe than the wars of the preceding and succeeding centuries. However, the late nineteenth century would witness a European scramble for colonies in Africa and parts of Asia: From the</p>

        <p class="page-num">986</p>

        <p>perspective of these regions, then, the later nineteenth century is an entirely different time period from the earlier nineteenth century. This epoch of colonization will be one of our main concerns in this chapter.</p>

        <p>We discussed the Great Divergence in chapter 22. Whatever one's view of the difference between average incomes in Europe and other continents in 1800, it is clear that these were radically different by 1914. We trace the technological and institutional (and transport infrastructure and technology) trajectory of European economic growth from the late eighteenth century, and how this slowly spread to other continents, in chapter 24. Here again, the long nineteenth century appears not as a century of stability but of significant transformations within some regions and resulting transformations of relations between regions. There is, not surprisingly, a connection between Europe's rising economic influence and its increased political control.</p>

        <p>We will in chapter 25 place the American and French Revolutions in a global context. We will note important differences between the influences on, the course of, and the effects of the two. We will engage with a series of revolutions that followed in other countries over the nineteenth century.</p>

        <p>These revolutions, though of considerable importance, may not be the most important political changes of the nineteenth century. We have discussed the institutions of slavery and serfdom in several preceding chapters. Through much of human history, some humans were either enslaved or enserfed. Over the course of the nineteenth century, both slavery and serfdom were abolished throughout almost the entire world. Though illegal slavery continues to this day in some parts of the world, the end to legal slavery and serfdom must qualify as one of the most important transformations in human history. It is the subject of chapter 26.</p>

        <p>The nineteenth century marks important transformations in areas such as gender roles, the environmental impact of human activity, the role of the state, and population growth. Since each of these transformations continues into and generally accelerates in the twentieth century, we will discuss nineteenth- and twentieth-century developments together in chapters 27 and 31. In this chapter, we will investigate remarkable nineteenth-century changes in the organization of work, transport systems, the world of science, and agriculture.</p>

        <p>We will address a diverse range of themes in this chapter. Colonization was a rather intense form of societal interaction. Transport improvements also intensified contact between societies. We will later discuss how institutions governing both work and science were transmitted across societies. With respect to agriculture, natural fertilizers became an important trade item in the late nineteenth century. We consider how technologies, institutions, and scientific insights built on what had gone before, but do not employ formal evolutionary analysis; we do, though, have cause more than once to mention the emergence of evolutionary theory itself.</p>

        <p class="page-num">987</p>

        <h2>Colonization</h2>

        <p>We discussed in chapter 19 how European countries came to colonize the Americas and parts of Africa and Asia from the fifteenth century. While Europe had colonized almost all of the Americas at one time, most of Africa and Asia remained independent as the nineteenth century began. Europeans had found it relatively easy to colonize the Americas as epidemic disease decimated local populations. Smallish trading posts had long served European trading interests in Asia and Africa; European countries had only slowly expanded their territorial holdings over time to secure supplies of raw materials. In Africa, European susceptibility to tropical disease had long discouraged movement beyond coastal trading posts.</p>

        <p>By 1914, though, European states had colonized most of Asia and almost all of Africa. Indeed Europe – or former European colonies in the Americas – controlled an astounding 84 per cent of the earth's surface by 1914. In Asia, the Europeans faced and conquered large states. The British took Malaya (for tin and rubber) and Burma (now Myanmar, for rice, timber – especially teak, jade, ivory, and oil). The French expanded in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos (for rice and rubber). The Dutch extended their hold on Indonesia (adding rubber, tin, and tobacco to long-standing spice, sugar, coffee, and tea exports). The Germans came later and took eastern New Guinea and some Pacific Islands. Europeans did not officially conquer China but the Qing Empire, after a series of military engagements with European gunboats, would grant European powers spheres of influence in which they could trade unimpeded. Thailand also managed</p>

        <p>to retain its independence by skilfully playing European powers against each other: The French and British came to accept it as a useful buffer between their respective colonies.</p>

        <p>In Africa, Europeans generally had to deal with a larger number of small polities. They also had to face desert, rainforest, and un-navigable rivers. Intrepid explorers had only mapped the interior of the continent in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. As late as 1875, Europeans held just a few coastal enclaves. Europeans were attracted inland by ivory (used mainly for piano keys and billiard balls), peanuts, and tropical woods, but would then develop coffee, sugar, and rubber plantations. (Africa had grown peanuts for centuries, but these expanded in importance after Columbus; in the nineteenth century, peanut oil was an important lubricant and ingredient in soap before synthetic lubricants replaced it.) Cloves were important in eastern Africa. Southern Africa might have declined when its role in supporting shipping between Asia and Europe was eclipsed by the Suez Canal after 1869 (see below), but substantial deposits of gold and diamonds were discovered from the 1870s. The British attempted to link their colonies in South Africa and Egypt (aspiring to an all-British Cape to Cairo route). The French would come to dominate West Africa and hoped to link possessions there with the small French outpost on the Red Sea to the east. The French and British almost fought a war in central Africa in 1898 because of their competing east–west versus north–south visions, but the French backed down. It should be noted that neither vision made a great deal of economic sense since the vast bulk of colonial trade moved directly to the coast rather than overland across the continent. The Portuguese expanded their holdings in Angola and Mozambique that dated from the time of early Portuguese exploration (chapter 19). Again, the Germans came late and occupied what are now Namibia and Tanzania. The Italians attacked Ethiopia, the only remaining independent state in Africa (excluding Liberia, a small state in West Africa founded by freed slaves), but were defeated in 1896 by an Ethiopian army trained in the use of European weapons. To limit conflict between European powers, these agreed at the Berlin conference of 1884–5 that each could exercise power inland where they had a coastal presence. They could then each focus military efforts on suppressing local rebellions: Germany killed some 70,000 rebels in what is now Tanzania between 1905 and 1907.</p>

        <p>The most horrific story of African colonization involved the Belgian king Leopold II in the Congo. From 1871, he had employed the explorer Henry Stanley to establish trading stations along the Congo River. Stanley negotiated treaties with hundreds of local chiefs that gave him and Leopold power over a vast area. The colonizers then forced the local population onto rubber plantations and into (especially copper) mines. The colony would become infamous for its brutality. Overseers killed or maimed workers for not producing enough or for resisting authority. Some ten million Congolese died. In 1908, an embarrassed Belgian state would take official control from Leopold, though rule remained harsh.</p>

        <p class="page-num">990</p>

        <p>As in Africa, there had been limited direct colonization of Pacific Islands before the late nineteenth century, though Europeans had often insisted on trading rights. The French turned a protectorate into a formal colony in eastern Polynesia in 1880, and Britain made Fiji a colony in 1874. Germany took several Marshall Islands in the 1870s. The Berlin conference of 1884–5 addressed Pacific Islands as well, and in the next decades these were annexed by the United States and European countries. Tonga remained nominally independent though Britain protected it.</p>

        <p>A set of technological innovations facilitated European conquests. One was quinine. The Incas had long appreciated the medicinal properties of the cinchona tree, and Jesuits had taken cinchona to Europe in the sixteenth century. It was used medicinally in Europe after that; it is said that Charles II of Britain was cured of malaria with cinchona. Quinine, the medicinal element of cinchona, was isolated in 1820 and named after the Inca word for the tree. Its production would allow Europeans – who had no immunity to malaria – to survive in the tropics. It would remain the leading anti-malarial medication until the 1940s when drugs with fewer side effects were developed.</p>

        <p>We discussed in chapter 18 how and why Europe had pulled ahead of the rest of the world with respect to gunpowder weapons. Over the nineteenth century, as Europe industrialized and developed steam engine technology, it also pulled ahead in the construction of naval ships. Iron ships could carry much larger cannons than wooden ships and were better able to withstand attack. The combination of better guns and stronger ships led to "gunboat diplomacy": The appearance of powerful ships in coastal ports, with cannons that could destroy local shipping and fortifications, forced local rulers throughout Asia and Africa to make political concessions. When Europeans needed to march inland, improvements in machine guns allowed small numbers of European troops to massacre large numbers of local forces. The Maxim gun from the 1880s could fire eleven bullets per second with considerable accuracy. The British used machine guns against the Mahdi (an Islamic revival state) in Sudan in 1898 (The Mahdi had beaten the British in 1885); they lost 40 soldiers while killing 11,000 and injuring 16,000. The military advantage was in most cases far greater than that exercised by Europeans in the Americas centuries earlier.</p>

        <p>These technologies allowed European conquest. But why did Europe want colonies? Economic growth in Europe and the development of new technologies during the Second Industrial Revolution increased European demand for a host of</p>

        <p>plant and mineral resources. Many Europeans believed that guaranteed access to both raw materials and markets was critical to economic success. The development of steamships and railways increased the potential advantages of both. However, the fact that European countries continued to prosper after shedding colonies in the twentieth century (chapters 29 and 30) suggests that colonies were far from economically necessary. As was the case with empires earlier in history, colonial expansion may have served the interests of European elites more than the average European. Elites could, as always, benefit from the theft associated with conquest, including gaining rights to mine or establish plantations without compensating locals (much). The average European may have gained little to compensate for the military costs associated with empire (though European states might have maintained reasonably large militaries to scare each other anyway). The European soldiers and administrators that served in colonies did generally benefit from both higher wages and the age-old opportunities for abuse of power over locals. However, these numbers were often small relative to both local and imperial populations: There were only ever a little over a thousand British occupying the top spots in the Indian bureaucracy, and some 80,000 British troops exercising control over 300,000 local troops. It was much less expensive to employ locals when possible in both</p>

        <p class="page-num">994</p>

        <p>bureaucracy and army. The British may have drawn on the Chinese example in establishing an examination system to recruit Indians into the civil service (and later employed examinations in Britain itself); these jobs became quite prestigious.</p>

        <p>Colonization took on a momentum of its own. European nationalists came to see another critical motive for taking a new colony: to prevent other states from getting it. We have seen that the French and British had competing ambitions. The Germans and Italians shortly after unification would accept the logic of empire espoused by the French, British, and Dutch and scrambled to take whatever lands these had not yet taken. In this last stage of colonization, the potential economic value of a particular colony might matter very little.</p>

        <p>We have seen that empires throughout history have not just relied on brute force but also always sought to justify their rule. European empires were no different. Indeed, these not only wished to provide some rationale to those they colonized but needed to satisfy those back home that colonies were both just and worthwhile. Since European nation states were themselves justified in terms of ideas of popular sovereignty (chapter 21), it was no simple task to explain colonial subjugation. However, European rulers could appeal to nationalist sentiment, which itself often reflected ideas of ethnic superiority. Europeans argued that European civilization was superior. (This is one reason we have generally avoided the use of the word "civilization" in this book.) Local peoples in Asia and Africa were judged unable or unprepared to operate mature economies or polities. Europeans then had a responsibility to bring "civilization" to such people. Such an idea may seem laughable in the context of the glories of Asian and African societies through the millennia that we have encountered throughout this book. Such histories were less well known in the nineteenth century, and were simply overlooked in the celebration of evidence of European superiority in industrial and military technology. Rudyard Kipling's poem "The White Man's Burden" of 1899, in which he celebrated the civilizing mission of Europeans (his particular focus at the time was United States intervention in the Philippines), is now decried as racist but captured much (but far from unanimous) popular feeling of the time.</p>

        <p>Europeans often argued that it was only proper to ensure that the resources of colonial lands were properly utilized. They often suggested that these resources were unused or unowned by local people, ignoring complaints of locals who were pushed off lands or coerced into working in mines. Though local residents would often participate in ownership or management of plantations and mines, Europeans tended to occupy the best positions in most ventures.</p>

        <p>There was tension within these ideas of European superiority. As Kipling's title hinted, it was common to think that there was some genetic advantage of White over Black or Asian peoples. Though arguments of cultural superiority dominated in the early days of colonization, ideas of racial superiority became more common over time. Such ideas were often associated with misapplications of Darwinian theories of evolution: European conquest appeared then as merely another case of the survival of the fittest. Yet ideas of European superiority</p>

        <p>often remained grounded in history rather than genes: Europeans had merely developed better values and institutions. If this were the case, then one might hope that Asians and Africans could be educated to match European achievements. Colonial governments often voiced such intentions. As we shall see in chapter 30, though, colonies were generally woefully unprepared for independence after generations of colonial rule. Colonial powers made limited efforts to educate locals – beyond perhaps a narrow group that might be useful in local bureaucracy. The civilizing mission took second place to the benefits of the social and economic subordination that the idea of European superiority could so easily justify.</p>

        <p>As we shall see in chapter 30, members of colonized societies often spoke eloquently about the inequities of colonial rule. The debate about the justice of colonialism was thus global in scope. Opponents of colonization within colonizing nations interacted with opponents based in the colonies. Advocates of colonialism had to react to arguments coming from the colonies. Steamships and telegraph cables meant that colonial arguments – and descriptions of acts of colonial repression – reached audiences in colonial countries quickly.</p>

        <p>What were the effects of colonies? As noted above, the economic benefits to European countries may have been modest. This may especially have been the case for the last colonies taken just for the sake of having colonies. Competition for colonies may have inflamed nationalist sentiments in Europe, setting the stage for World War I (chapter 28): In particular, German nationalists grated at the fact that the French and British had much more extensive empires. This encouraged them to think of colonizing parts of Europe itself. Cultural effects may have been far greater: Europeans would often absorb cuisine and arts and crafts from their colonies: The first curry restaurant in London opened in 1809.</p>

        <p>The effects on the colonized were much greater. Some benefits may have occurred with the transmission of European technologies and the identification of trade opportunities. Colonizers often introduced new crops such as tea and rubber from one colony to another, albeit under harsh conditions of production and with local farmers pushed off their land. Hospitals and schools were established. Though these might mostly serve the European population or a small local elite, some transfer of medical technologies and science occurred. (European governesses for local elite children were another avenue by which European science and attitudes were transmitted to local elites.) In some cases, European colonization ended warfare among small local polities. Europeans built thousands of kilometres of railways in their colonies, though these often merely linked mines and ports. Colonizers introduced legal systems, though these generally favoured Europeans.</p>

        <p class="page-num">997</p>

        <p>The negative effects of colonization were immense. Colonization often displaced existing and effective political and economic institutions. Though European colonizers, like past empires, often governed through local elites, Europeans generally occupied the top positions in colonial bureaucracies. Even just a few decades of colonization, then, could destroy local institutions but not prepare locals to run the new institutions. There was also significant environmental damage from mines and plantations; imperial authorities did from the 1920s undertake some efforts to protect wildlife and forests and waterways, but often without consulting the locals most affected by these plans. In addition to these longer-term costs, there were the short-term costs always associated with power disparities in a society: discrimination, lack of freedom, and death or assault at the hands of the military or police. Scholars estimate that some 30–50 million people died in famines in the late nineteenth century that colonial authorities largely ignored.</p>

        <p>We noted back in Box 6.2 that social stratification always has a gender component. We saw in chapter 19 that colonial authorities in the Americas worried about sexual relationships between European men and local women. Though women increasingly accompanied officials to European colonies in the nineteenth century, there was still a severe gender imbalance in European populations in the colonies. European men then took local concubines. Colonial authorities generally tried and failed to limit such sexual interactions. Different colonies made different accommodations. In French West Africa, children of mixed parentage could not inherit land from their mothers or marry locals. They became a local trading elite that operated between Europeans and locals. Yet in various colonies the British, French, and Dutch recognized some marriages between European men and local women, and were willing to grant citizenship to small numbers of children of such marriages. (The French in 1928 would allow all children of mixed parentage to apply for French citizenship.) These were still generally prevented from reaching the very top levels of colonial governance, the appointment of James Douglas as the first governor of the then-small colony of British Columbia in 1851 being a notable exception. European men often treated local concubines poorly but at other times fought for the recognition of their rights and their children's rights. Colonial authorities were generally even more hostile to relationships between European women and local men, though many European women travelled to North Africa or the Caribbean for this purpose in the late nineteenth century. Local men sometimes sought to limit local female interaction with colonizers, but sometimes saw advantages in their sisters or daughters forging connections with rulers. Muslim men often disparaged Europeans for not secluding their women, while western men often disparaged men on Pacific Islands for not limiting the sexual behaviour of local women (we have seen that Pacific men may have valued the strategic importance of relations between local women and European men).</p>

        <p>European authorities often legislated European family law, limiting polygamy, allowing widow remarriage, banning child marriage, encouraging</p>

        <p class="page-num">998</p>

        <p>marital choice, and allowing women to hold property; they often encouraged some education of girls. Such laws were important in justifying colonialism in Europe. Local women in the colonies often welcomed these initiatives but sometimes saw them as interference with the traditional local family.</p>

        <p class="page-num">999</p>

        <h3>South Africa and Algeria</h3>

        <p>As noted above, Europeans had generally only had small coastal possessions in Africa until the late nineteenth century. There were two exceptions. One was South Africa. The Dutch had established a thriving colony there in the mid seventeenth century to provide supplies to ships sailing between Europe and Asia. The soil and temperate climate of the region proved quite amenable to a variety of European crops (including grapes for wine). The Indigenous peoples of the area had not previously had access to these crops and had not developed agriculture. The Dutch East India Company had not intended a large colony for it wished only to supply its ships. They forced prisoners from both Europe and Java to work in their new colony but also encouraged some free migration. The European population would spread along the coast and begin to explore inland. The British would take over the colony, at first temporarily when the Netherlands fell to the French in the Napoleonic Wars, but would then establish permanent control. The British also showed little interest in the colony at first. Nevertheless, they, like the Dutch before them, followed a policy of pushing local Black populations off the best farmland so that Europeans could take this.</p>

        <p class="page-num">1000</p>

        <p>This land policy continued after the British abolished slavery in all of their domains in 1837 (chapter 26). The British established an elected assembly, but Blacks could not vote. Nevertheless Dutch settlers (the Boers) chafed at British rule – and the imposition of English as the official language – and trekked inland from 1834–41, pushing local Blacks onto reservations. The Zulu people under their leader Shaka raised an army of 40,000 that fought in formation with spears. This army pushed other tribes out of the area, but the resulting Zulu kingdom would fall to the British in 1879. British interest in the region rose dramatically with the discovery of diamonds in 1867 and gold in 1886. Thousands of British miners moved in. Taxation in cash forced many Blacks to work in mines (in the lower-paying jobs). Mines also employed tens of thousands of indentured servants from China until White miners went on strike about these taking the best jobs. Political conflict between the inland Boer republics and the British colony led to the Boer War of 1898–1901, which the British won. Though there was a tacit agreement between Boers and British not to employ Black troops, both sides did so; ten thousand died in a British internment camp. The British established a dominion with assemblies dominated by Whites from 1913.</p>

        <p>French soldiers landed in Algeria in 1827 to confront pirates operating along the coast. From 1830, the French established a colony in the coastal region of Algeria. French troops would kill some 825,000 Algerians – over 10 per cent of the population – over the next decades. From 1848, coastal Algeria was treated not as a colony but as part of France – but only European settlers were recognized as citizens. As in South Africa, Europeans found the fertile agricultural lands along the Mediterranean attractive – but here there was already a farming population that they had to remove from the land. There would be half a million people of European heritage in Algeria by 1900 (about 13 per cent of the population); their descendants would leave Algeria at independence in the 1950s (chapter 30).</p>

        <h3>Japan and colonialism</h3>

        <p>American gunboats had forced Japan to open itself to international trade in 1853–4 (Americans had previously gained some familiarity with Japan by whaling in adjacent seas). In the ensuing years, it seemed that Japan might follow the Chinese trajectory of becoming subject to foreign domination. The Meiji Restoration of 1868 – in which the emperor assumed nominal power from the Tokugawa shoguns – was motivated in large part by a desire to avoid foreign colonization. Japanese leaders built on a long tradition of central governance and a shared language and culture to urge nationalism but also the adoption of Western technologies. As we have seen in earlier chapters, Japan had in preceding centuries borrowed many ideas from China while remaining culturally and politically distinct. Japan would send students to study abroad and import experts to transmit military and industrial technology. It modelled its army on Germany's and its navy on Britain's. It encouraged railways, telegraphs, mining, and industry – and Western laws, attire and the seven-day week. It had already achieved literacy rates similar to Europe's in 1868 but by 1905 over 90 per cent of both boys and girls would attend primary school. It developed modern universities also from 1886.</p>

        <p>Along with technology, Japanese leaders would absorb the idea that a strong country needed colonies. The desire to avoid colonization segued quickly into a felt need to colonize. Japan occupied Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands to the south from 1879. They then took Taiwan (and the Liaodong peninsula and Pescadore islands) from China in 1895, and effectively gained control over Korea (and treaty rights like Europeans within China itself). The Japanese at the time employed ships bought from the British. Still, European powers forced the Japanese out of Liaodong. This led to conflict with Russia, and a Japanese victory against the Russian navy that surprised many in 1904–5. Japanese colonial ambitions would then be important in the world wars of the twentieth century (chapter 28).</p>

        <p>Japan could not justify its conquests in quite the same language employed by Europeans. It would often describe itself as saving Asians from European dominance. Yet it came to celebrate the superiority of Japanese ways – despite</p>

        <p class="page-num">1001</p>

        <p>centuries of applauding Chinese practices. Japan would treat those it colonized similarly to how Europeans behaved in their colonies. Japan killed most of the aboriginal population in Taiwan, and established separate school systems for Chinese and Japanese there. As in European colonies, they also built much useful infrastructure.</p>

        <h3>American imperialism?</h3>

        <p>Much ink has been spilled over the question of whether the United States has been an imperial power. Unfortunately, much of this has reflected terminological confusion. Some writers define imperialism loosely to mean any sort of self-interested interference by a powerful country in the affairs of a less powerful country. Others define imperialism more narrowly as explicit territorial conquest. These different definitions can guide different answers to the question. This book has favoured the more precise definition of empire for reasons of clarity. It may indeed be somewhat hypocritical for a country to decry imperialism of the narrow sort while pursuing imperialism of the broader kind, but these imperialisms are nevertheless quite distinct in both how they operate and how they affect the weaker country. Our definition has not guided us to ignore the other ways in which powerful states influence the less powerful, but rather to treat these as important processes in their own right.</p>

        <p>The United States has a long history of opposing the narrow sort of imperialism. The American Revolution was justified in this way. In 1823 the Monroe doctrine would warn European states that the United States would oppose colonial endeavours in the Americas (most Spanish and Portuguese colonies were gaining independence at that time; chapter 25). In the twentieth century, the United States would urge the break-up of the defeated Ottoman and Austrian Empires after World War I (chapter 28) and support the more general move toward decolonization after World War II (chapter 30). Yet as we saw in chapter 19, much of the territory of the United States was gained by conquest or purchase. This process would continue in the late nineteenth century. The United States bought Alaska from Russia in 1867. It established a protectorate over the Hawaiian kingdom in 1875, and accepted the invitation of the American plantation owners there to assume full control after these had overthrown the queen in 1893. The Americans fought the Spanish–American War of 1898 as an anti-colonial venture. When American troops stayed in the Philippines rather than delivering the promised independence, a Filipino revolt cost 200,000 Filipino lives. Debate raged in the United States (to an even greater extent than in European democracies such as Britain) as to whether a democracy could have colonies. As Americans settled in large numbers in Alaska and Hawaii, these came to be recognized as states. The Philippines gained autonomy in 1935 and independence in 1946 – somewhat earlier than most European colonies gained independence (chapter 30). Puerto Rico and a smattering of small Caribbean and Pacific islands have remained American territories, generally with local support.</p>

        <p class="page-num">1002</p>

        <h3>Mining</h3>

        <p>We mentioned mining several times above. We have seen in earlier chapters that even in ancient times valuable minerals might be carried hundreds or even thousands of kilometres. In the early years of European industrial revolutions (chapter 24), minerals were generally obtained in Europe itself. However, over the course of the nineteenth century, a global trade in key minerals emerged. Tin would become especially important as tin cans were used to preserve food from about 1810. Copper would gain increased importance in wiring as electrification spread.</p>

        <p>We wondered for the ancient period how minerals were discovered and mined within territories characterized by less sophisticated economic and political institutions (chapter 5). Likewise in the nineteenth century, mineral deposits that might be of limited interest to the local economy had to be identified and extracted. Mining is an expensive and technically demanding pursuit. Financial institutions in London and other centres funded mines – and the railways to reach them (with occasional bouts of senseless speculation as investors struggled to value distant mines). Mines were designed and managed by a mobile community of mining engineers, many from the United States (Herbert Hoover, later president during the Great Depression, had been one).</p>

        <p>Mining tasks are often dangerous and dirty. Local workers often had to be encouraged to work in mines. In some locales they were forced. Elsewhere, mines enticed them with higher wages than they could earn in agriculture. The need to pay colonial taxes encouraged many toward mine work. Local workers often suffered racist disdain. Workers in Africa often migrated long distances to work in mines, a practice that disrupted family life.</p>

        <p>Advocates of nineteenth-century colonization argued that only colonial governments could adequately protect Western capital and skilled workers, provide clear property rights over expensive mines, and organize the necessary local labour force. However, independent Latin America, and Chile in particular, was also an important site of mining investment. This global trade in minerals has expanded in the decades following decolonization – though mining companies have often been accused of bribing local governments.</p>

        <p>Most of the world's tin came from what are now Malaysia and Indonesia in the late nineteenth century; Bolivia and Nigeria produced smaller quantities. Southeast Asian tin was highly valued for its purity, which allowed tin coatings to be very thin. Surface tin deposits had been harvested for centuries, and Chinese merchants financed some mining activities in the area. As the easiest deposits were mined out, it became necessary either to dig deeper or harvest inferior ores. The British and Dutch strengthened their control over Malaya and the tin islands of Indonesia respectively as mining operations increased. Processes that scarred the local environment were employed. Hydraulic mining washed entire hillsides through sluices and into local waterways, often clogging these. Dredging in deltas deposited tons of soil and rock from deep below the</p>

        <h2>Transport</h2>

        <p>We have mentioned transport improvements above, and we will do so again in many later chapters. They are a crucial element in nineteenth (and twentieth)-century history, facilitating trade, investment, migration, and the spread of ideas. The railway (termed railroad in the United States) was invented at the very start of the nineteenth century in Britain. The railway was an unforeseen result of industrialization, wedding advanced steam engine and iron-production technology with rails first employed to get coal out of mines. Railways soon became a critical means of transporting both goods and people. They could excel at the tasks previously played by both road and water transport (Box 5.3). Railways were often less expensive than transportation by water and yet faster than transport by road. Like roads, they could extend almost anywhere – though railways faced challenges in climbing steep hills. Railways in Britain would expand from under 160 kilometres in 1830 to over 10,000 by 1860. The figures for the United States were 65 kilometres in 1830, 28,900 in</p>

        <p class="page-num">1004</p>

        <div class="illustration-placeholder">

</div>

        <p>1860, and 163,000 in 1890, peaking at 254,000 in 1916. Worldwide there were around 800,000 kilometres of railway by 1900, and some construction occurred in virtually every country. Railways added speed and convenience where good systems of road and water transport existed, and opened regions such as the western plains of North America or parts of the Russian steppe that were not well served by roads or water transport.</p>

        <p>Though the initial purpose of the new transcontinental railways in North America was to connect North American farms or mines to urban or foreign markets, they came to play a role in global commerce. Indeed, for the last decades of the nineteenth century and first decades of the twentieth century, the fastest trains in both Canada and the United States carried raw silk from Japan to cities such as New York for use in textile manufacture. Given the high price of silk at the time (and thus costs of insuring it), it made sense to ship it by (faster) rail rather than by sea. Only when silk prices fell due to the development of synthetic fibres in the interwar period (prices also fell in part because of the Great Depression) did this traffic shift to the Panama Canal (below). Silk trains were famous not just for top speeds of well over 90 kilometres per hour but also for the speed with which engines were changed and wheels lubricated along the way. Silk trains also had special carriages designed to take corners fast.</p>

        <p>Steamships were developed in both Europe and the United States soon after the railway. By 1900, there would be 4,000 steamships on the Mississippi River alone. The paddlewheels used on calm rivers and lakes were ill-suited to the waves of the open ocean. Screw propellers allowed ocean travel. Costs of shipping and travel times across the Atlantic fell dramatically. It could take</p>

        <p class="page-num">1005</p>

        <p>two years for a return trip from Britain to India by sail; with steam, it took four months.</p>

        <p>Though steamships were faster than sail, they were still limited to much the same routes. The Suez Canal of 1859–69 would allow ships to move directly from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and thence to the Indian Ocean. The canal eliminated the millennia-old challenge of trans-shipment between these bodies of water. (Recall that a much smaller canal for much smaller boats had been temporarily built in classical times by the Persian emperor Darius between the Nile and the Red Sea; chapter 9.) The Suez Canal is over 160 kilometres long, and thus it was an impressive engineering feat – guided by French engineers and financed by Europeans but relying on Egyptian labour and government sponsorship. Forced labour was employed at first, and thousands of Egyptians died during construction, but heavy machinery was later employed. The flat terrain meant that a flat canal could be built that did not require ships to be raised and lowered in locks. The return trip from Britain to India fell to four weeks.</p>

        <p>Fuelled by success in Suez, French investors and engineers hoped to build a canal across Panama, linking the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. However, Panama was a far greater challenge. Much greater changes in altitude had to be managed. The tropical rainforests hosted both yellow fever and malaria that decimated the workforce. The United States would take over from the French. The United</p>

</div>

        <p>States would encourage Panamanian independence from Columbia to gain political authority over the Canal Zone (the United States would return the Canal Zone to Panama in 1979). Construction took ten years and was completed only in 1914. Though shorter than Suez, the Panama Canal required locks to raise ships 26 metres at both ends; Gatun Lake in central Panama was flooded to allow large ocean-going vessels to travel across the lake between the two canal segments. (It is a very peculiar sight to this day to observe huge ocean-going ships cross this smallish lake.)</p>

        <p>Though grains were the primary agricultural trade good by volume, consumers increasingly wanted to eat meat and a variety of fruits and vegetables. Even steamships using canals could not get meat or fruits or vegetables to distant markets fast enough. The answer was refrigeration. A variety of improvements in the design and insulation of ships would allow perishable crops to be transported long distances. In 1874, frozen beef was shipped from the United States to London. The challenges of refrigerating rail cars were more significant: There were barely 1,000 of these in the United States in 1880 but 70,000 by 1900. These developments in refrigeration encouraged ranching in the Americas and Australia (which was largely settled after refrigeration), and fruit and vegetable exports from many regions of the world.</p>

        <p>The volume of world trade increased ten times between 1850 and 1913. Its composition changed just as dramatically. This was no longer a luxury trade. Instead, bulky raw materials and basic consumption items now dominated</p>

        <p class="page-num">1007</p>

        <p>world trade. Most of the trade occurred between advanced economies, and especially between Europe and the Americas.</p>

        <p>Railways and steamships also served administrative purposes. States were better able to govern distant territories if they could quickly transport news and officials. The British could better rule India when messages took weeks rather than years. The telegraph – one of the first applications of the new scientific understanding of electricity – would from the 1830s lead to a further dramatic reduction in message time. When telegraph cable first came to India in 1879, it took only five hours for a message to reach Britain. A telegraph cable was laid across the Atlantic from Ireland to Newfoundland in 1866. Wireless transmission between Ireland and Newfoundland by Marconi in 1901 would further reduce the cost and time involved in international communication. The telegraph was not well suited to large documents, though, which usually were still sent by ship or rail. And telegrams were expensive: Only a few details of the massive volcanic eruption in Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883 were therefore reported in newspapers elsewhere in the world at the time; it would take years for Europeans to connect the dark skies and unusual weather they experienced to that eruption.</p>

        <p>As steamships, railways, and telegraphs tied the world together, there was pressure to standardize the treatment of time itself. The European calendar with twelve months and weeks of seven days was adopted through much of the world, at least by merchants engaged in international trade. (A lunar calendar would also survive in China and much of the Islamic world.) So too was the idea of twenty-four hours of sixty minutes. Until late in the century, though, each city set its clocks so that noon occurred when the sun was at its highest. Such a practice wreaked havoc on railway timetables. International agreement on the present system of twenty-four time zones, each separated by an hour from neighbouring zones (with some exceptions) was achieved in 1884, though some states were slow to adopt it.</p>

        <p class="page-num">1008</p>

        <h2>Changes in work</h2>

        <p>We will in chapter 24 discuss how modern factory-based industry spread through the world. We should appreciate that most humans were still engaged in agriculture in 1900, and that the service sector would eclipse manufacturing in most of the world in the twentieth century. Nevertheless, the spread of factories transformed the world of work. Most obviously, a workforce of paid and supervised industrial workers emerged which slowly eclipsed industrial production by skilled artisans in homes or small workshops. As urbanization proceeded (chapter 31), these workers organized to fight for better working conditions and political rights.</p>

        <p>Britain, as the home of the first Industrial Revolution, witnessed some of the earliest and nastiest confrontations between labour and political and economic elites. After numerous violent strikes, the rights to unionize and strike gained</p>

        <p class="page-num">1009</p>

        <div class="illustration-placeholder">

</div>

        <p>legal recognition in 1871. A series of Reform Acts expanded the electorate: By 1867, a third of males could vote, including many industrial workers; the electorate doubled again in 1884. Workers also agitated for public education, though employers and the state also saw advantages in this: It was enacted in 1870.</p>

        <p>States tended to introduce legal rights for workers, political rights, and social policies such as public education as industrialization spread to other countries. Though some countries copied British precedents, sometimes in a deliberate attempt to catch up, there were violent confrontations in many countries as armies, police, or private security forces ended strikes with force. As in earlier cities, rulers had to worry about the potential for rebellion of urban masses – but these urban masses were now larger and had a collective experience of supervised wage labour. Worker rebellions in 1848 in many European countries (chapter 25) were brutally repressed: 10,000 were killed in Paris alone. Yet countries such as Germany would later introduce social policies to satisfy industrial workers. Karl Marx and other writers grappled with this dramatic change in the composition of the labour force (we discuss communism in chapter 27); their calls for radical political and economic reform encouraged a mixture of violent repression and enlightened social policy from governments around</p>

        <p class="page-num">1010</p>

        <p>the world (we discuss social policy in chapters 27 and 29). Marx's ideas would inspire revolutions in Russia in 1917 and China in 1949, among others (see chapter 27). However, these revolutions did not occur as he predicted in the most advanced economies.</p>

        <p>One common trend worldwide was a reduction in the length of the working week. In the early Industrial Revolution, workers worked six days a week for ten to sixteen hours a day. French workers agitated successfully for a maximum of twelve hours after 1848. Workers in many countries then agitated for five days of eight hours, a goal that would be widely achieved in the early decades of the twentieth century (after which workweeks largely stabilized). As workweeks shortened, entertainments such as theatres and amusement parks grew in importance. The working class now had time to both participate in sports and watch these (while children in school had more opportunity for sports than previous generations in factories). Since the social changes that facilitated organized sports originated in Europe, and especially Britain, sports such as soccer and cricket and rounders (the antecedent of baseball) and rugby (the forerunner of American and Canadian football) came to dominate global sporting events. North America played a subsidiary role, with baseball and football developed in the northern United States, and hockey and basketball in Canada (Europeans had borrowed polo from Asia). Wrestling proved very popular in the Middle East and India. Men outside Europe and North America – and especially colonial men – may have seen sport as a venue for displaying masculinity in a world dominated militarily by Europe. In any case, cricket became popular in South Asia, baseball in Japan, and soccer in Latin America. At the end of the nineteenth century, the modern Olympic movement would also originate in Europe. It was hoped that international sports could lessen international tensions, just as the ancient Olympics was intended to encourage Greek solidarity (chapter 10).</p>

        <p>As just noted, one fundamental characteristic of the new working class was that it was supervised in large industrial establishments. Along with the working class, then, a new managerial class emerged. Though there had long been state bureaucrats in history, there had not previously been large numbers of managers of industrial establishments. Railways, shipping companies, and water and sewer systems also required management. The number of lawyers expanded with increased government activity and regulation as well as clarification of land titles. Financial institutions would grow in size and complexity, and marketing would become an important profession in its own right. Engineering would blossom as a profession. As health, education, and the service sector more generally grew in size through the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this "middle class" – neither manual labourers nor owners of large enterprises – increased in size. The middle class had been a small minority in previous human societies but would come to be larger than the working class in many countries during the nineteenth century.</p>

        <p>This middle class too would agitate for democracy in many countries. Its political goals were sometimes the same as the working class: Both fought for</p>

        <p class="page-num">1011</p>

        <p>education and healthcare. However, the middle class might often align with the upper class in seeking protection of property. Nevertheless, the existence of a growing middle class likely served to weaken tensions between the working class and the industrial elite. As public education spread and the service sector grew, there was considerable mobility between the working class and middle class. Economically, the growing middle class – along with increased wages in the working class – provided a market for a wide range of goods and services (including the entertainments noted above). The middle class was also an essential market for the global trade in consumer goods that expanded through the century (chapter 24). Ironically, though most of the middle class had official workweeks similar to those in the working class, they often needed to be available outside of work hours – some would then see their actual workweeks increase in the late twentieth century as mobile phones and the internet made them available at all times. Culturally, middle-class values and standards of dress tended to be considered dominant, at least by members of the middle class. The middle class tended to stress "respectability," which in turn meant education, ethical behaviour, belief in hard work and advancement through merit, and appreciation of family. There was always a tension between valuing family and valuing merit: Should the middle class hire its own children or ensure that working-class children had access to quality education?</p>

        <p>In the colonies, ethnic minorities that intervened between locals and colonial administrators or merchants often dominated the middle class. These colonial middle classes were often less self-confident than the middle classes of independent states. The "divide-and-rule" strategies often pursued by colonial governments could inspire distaste for successful minority groups that worked with colonial authorities.</p>

        <p>Most agrarian societies in human history had been characterized by a large mass of peasants and a small elite. The development of a large middle class could work to reduce stark differentials in the distribution of both incomes and power. It appears that the upward trend in income inequality which we have observed through much of human history (albeit interrupted by periodic shocks) was attenuated in the second half of the nineteenth century (and may even have been reversed a little) in many/most countries as the middle class expanded in size and middle-class incomes rose. However, the late nineteenth century was also a period in which some industrialists and financiers amassed unprecedented fortunes, ensuring that measures of wealth or income inequality would not fall too far. We have discussed above the role that the middle class (and working class) played in agitating for political change, and will return to a discussion of the role of the middle class in encouraging democracy in chapter 27 (and will discuss the relationship between income inequality and democracy again in chapter 32).</p>

        <p>We can also speak of certain classes that declined in importance in the nineteenth century. However, the international experience of class decline is far more diverse. Landowners lost social status and political influence in much of western Europe, but not farther east. The samurai in Japan had maintained</p>

        <p class="page-num">1012</p>

        <p>a ceremonial social status after they lost their military function to peasant infantries but would lose their special legal status after the Meiji Restoration of 1868. The Chinese scholar elite would remain influential into the twentieth century. The British would decide to rule through Indian princes in the late nineteenth century, enhancing their status and power.</p>

        <p>The large factories of the nineteenth century changed the landscape along with the world of work. Some of these factories still operate, others have been transformed into warehouses or retail space or even apartment buildings, and a very few have been appreciated as examples of industrial design. The vast majority have been torn down.</p>

        <h2>Science</h2>

        <p>Though discoveries continued in long-standing scientific pursuits such as astronomy, the nineteenth century is especially notable for the development of new lines of scientific enquiry. Electricity had been known for centuries (as static electricity mainly; Benjamin Franklin had established in the eighteenth century that lightning was electrical) but not systematically studied. Scientific experiments would pave the way for the telegraph in the 1830s and the generation, transmission, and application of electrical power late in the century (chapter 24). Even more surprisingly, the scientific study of electrical waves would set the stage for radio transmission at the very end of the century (above). This is indeed one of the great examples in history of scientific curiosity having unimagined practical implications.</p>

        <p>The discovery early in the century that electrical currents could stimulate chemical reactions supported a theory that electrical charges held chemicals</p>

        <p class="page-num">1015</p>

        <p>together. This, in turn, encouraged the development of atomic theory and, late in the century, the development of the periodic table of elements (in which each chemical element was identified with a specific number of protons). This enhanced understanding of chemistry would also stimulate a range of industrial innovations late in the nineteenth century (again, chapter 24). Artificial dyes would revolutionize textile manufacture from 1856, and similar techniques of investigating the qualities of different chemicals would soon thereafter be applied to pharmaceuticals. (German chemists isolated cocaine from the coca plant in the 1860s and patented it as a medicine; it would gain popularity as a recreational drug thereafter, with mixed consequences for coca farmers in Latin America.)</p>

        <p>Improved microscopes allowed the recognition of cells as the building block of all organisms. Whereas biology had before the nineteenth century consisted of atheoretical classifications of species, cell biology (and evolutionary theory, developed late in the nineteenth century; see chapter 1, 2) would guide a more theoretical investigation of the nature of biological systems. This would support medical advances in the twentieth century (and a new field of biotechnology later in the twentieth century after the nature of DNA was recognized). The first significant development came in 1874 when Louis Pasteur discovered that heating food products could kill disease-causing germs.</p>

        <p>Science also gained a new institutional structure. The foundation of the École Polytechnique from 1794 in revolutionary France made France the leading scientific nation for decades; prominent scientists gathered there and taught promising students. German states built upon this idea, founding</p>

        <p class="page-num">1016</p>

        <p>the modern research university from 1810. Professors in these institutions combined research and teaching. The teaching laboratory was developed, as was the graduate research seminar in which professors and students shared ideas. Though we saw that universities had played a role in the discoveries of the Scientific Revolution (chapter 22), the medieval European university had de-emphasized natural science. Medieval universities also had stressed teaching over research (often teaching classical theories of nature). The research university was so different from preceding universities that there was a discussion of inventing a new word to describe it. German scientists also advised German industry. As this collaboration began to bear fruit, other countries copied the idea of the research university. Still, late in the century American, Japanese, and other students flocked to Germany for the best scientific training available.</p>

        <p>We will re-encounter German research universities when we discuss the Second Industrial Revolution in chapter 24. We can note here that they played a critical role in building on the discoveries of Pasteur. Robert Koch and his students in north Germany would use microscopes to identify the causal agents of tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, diphtheria, gonorrhoea, and several other diseases in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This involved isolating a pathogen associated with some disease and infecting another animal with that pathogen. His student Petri developed the sterilized dish for isolating pathogens that still bears his name. Japanese student Shibasaburo Kitasato discovered the causal agent for bubonic plague. These various efforts reflected a desire for medical practices grounded in evidence. They set the stage for the development of a variety of pharmaceuticals in the twentieth century that would attack these various pathogens.</p>

        <p>Research universities are now so familiar that it may be surprising that they are only a couple of centuries old. It is easy also to take the manner of their organization for granted. Since science was opening up exciting new lines of enquiry, each with its own theories and instruments, these new research universities were organized from the start around disciplines. While universities had long taught courses on a variety of subjects, the goal had always been a general education. The scientists we met in chapter 22 had broad training and often explored a wide range of questions. The new research universities stressed disciplinary specialization for both professors and students. They would no longer be generalists but physicists, chemists, or biologists – and increasingly a particular kind of chemist or biologist. The social sciences, too, would split</p>

        <p class="page-num">1017</p>

        <p>into a handful of disciplines in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century: Political economy would become economics and political science, while anthropology and sociology would develop as new lines of enquiry (the ethnographic research of anthropologists, at first in the colonies and Latin America, later among workers at home, attracted great popular attention). Since most early professors relied on student tuition for their income, they each advertised the specialized courses that they could teach. Disciplinary specialization in the growing number of high schools duplicated and reinforced specialization in universities: Many university graduates went on to teach chemistry or physics in high school. The development of specialized education faculties in universities only slowly weakened this link between disciplinary specializations at the two levels.</p>

        <p>The disciplinary nature of universities would be matched by the foundation of disciplinary scholarly organizations within and then across countries in the last decades of the nineteenth century and early decades of the twentieth. Physicists would attend conferences with other physicists and publish in scholarly journals edited by physicists. These distinct disciplines would each develop a unique jargon to go with their specialized theories and methods. It became increasingly difficult, therefore, for a chemist to understand a physicist.</p>

        <p>This disciplinary specialization would be transcended in another novel institution of the late nineteenth century: the industrial research laboratory (chapter 24). Industrialists financed and organized these laboratories with the express purpose of developing novel technologies. The German chemical and pharmaceutical firm Bayer would establish such a laboratory in 1874; the American electrical innovator Edison would create a laboratory from 1876 that would first work on electric lighting and later develop phonographs and movies. Since scientific input was necessary for innovation in chemistry, electronics, and elsewhere, these laboratories generally employed an interdisciplinary mix of engineers and scientists from multiple disciplines. Engineering, it might be noted, had become an important discipline in its own right, charged with employing scientific theories and methods to identify best practices in the world of technology.</p>

        <p>The appreciation within industrial research laboratories that complex real-world challenges called for an interdisciplinary approach would feed back into the university very slowly. To be sure, some educators had decried increasing specialization from the very beginning. There would be many experiments with interdisciplinary teaching programmes within research universities in the early twentieth century. However, it was only in the postwar period that the advantages – and feasibility – of both interdisciplinary teaching and research were widely appreciated. Research universities by then had solidified an administrative structure grounded in disciplines. It has proven no easy task to institutionalize interdisciplinarity. Though interdisciplinary teaching and research programmes are now common (and we discussed some of the advantages of interdisciplinary analysis in chapter 1), university decision-making tends still to be dominated by disciplines.</p>

        <p class="page-num">1018</p>

        <p>The development and worldwide spread of both research universities and industrial research laboratories meant a dramatic increase in the number of scientists in the world. Marked increases in economic productivity allowed societies to support these large numbers (chapters 24, 29). Their training reflected massive investments in public education and research universities. The vast majority of the scientists that have ever lived have lived in the last decades. This increase in the numbers of scientists, and the fact that they had both time and equipment to devote to research, led to a dramatic increase in research output. Moreover, recall that scientific and technological advance is always a collaborative effort. The increased size of the scientific community increased the potential for useful collaboration. One challenge, though, has been keeping track of the flow of information: Scientists must struggle to ensure that they keep abreast of discoveries elsewhere and that others in turn recognize their discoveries.</p>

        <p>We can mention a few of the key developments in twentieth-century science here. Some late-nineteenth-century physicists thought that the most important discoveries in their field had all been made, but physics would be revolutionized in the next century by the theory of relativity (mass and energy are related, and time is not absolute), the investigation of subatomic particles and radioactivity (shedding of particles by heavy elements), and quantum theory, which sees particles and waves as not distinct. Nuclear bombs and nuclear power were the most obvious impacts but nuclear medicine has been important, and there are potential implications in electronics and computing. The discovery of genes and the decoding of DNA in the late twentieth century advanced biological understanding and created a whole biotechnology sector. Much of chapters 2 and 3 in this book were possible only because of advances in cosmological and biological understandings in the twentieth century.</p>

        <p>Scientific discoveries have been concentrated in those countries that could best finance research universities and industrial research laboratories. Only very late in the nineteenth century did the idea of the research university spread much beyond Europe and former European settler colonies. Nevertheless, there have always been important contributions from other countries: Charles Darwin interacted a great deal with scientists in Chile as he developed his theory of evolution. Moreover, the leading universities and laboratories have attracted people from throughout the world. There are thousands of Indian scientists and engineers in Silicon Valley in California, for example. As more countries have financed research universities, the location of scientific discovery has become more diffuse.</p>

        <p>We noted in chapter 9 the importance of libraries for sustained scientific and philosophical advance. In the nineteenth century, national libraries, archives, and museums were widely seen as a symbol of a modern nation state. The Louvre had become a public museum during the French Revolution, and other countries soon copied this idea – with colonial powers filling their museums with artefacts from their colonies. There was less publishing and therefore fewer and smaller libraries in the Islamic world –</p>

        <p class="page-num">1019</p>

        <div class="illustration-placeholder">

        <p>a dramatic change from earlier centuries in which the Islamic world housed the greatest libraries in the world (chapter 12). Though nationalism inspired these new national libraries and museums, they tended to collect globally. Charities and local governments developed local libraries and museums as well. The new research universities developed libraries for the use of instructors and students; these had to cope with an increasing volume of scientific publications. Both scientists and the public gained better access to information through these various developments. As the number and size of these institutions increased, specialized professions of librarian, archivist, and curator emerged, each with their own formal educational expectations.</p>

        <p class="page-num">1020</p>

        <h2>Agriculture</h2>

        <p>A variety of advances in science, transport, and industry would increase agricultural productivity over the nineteenth century, feeding the increased population of that century (chapter 31). A gradually warming climate aided agricultural output.</p>

        <p>Guano is a corruption of the Inca word "huanu." The Inca had used these bird droppings from islands off the Peruvian coast as fertilizer for centuries. In the 1830s, scientific understanding of plant growth combined with reduced transport costs and increased population to create a market in Europe for guano</p>

        <p class="page-num">1021</p>

        <div class="illustration-placeholder">

</div>

        <p>from off the South American west coast. The Peruvian government earned significant royalties from guano exports (though working conditions were decried), but defaulted in 1876 when guano exports fell.</p>

        <p>Europeans turned to nitrates on the border between Peru and Chile. Chile won a war in 1879–83 for control of these – a rare war among Latin American nation states. At the end of the century, phosphate deposits were discovered in the Pacific Island of Nauru; these would make Nauru one of the wealthiest places on earth for a while – though the island faced problems as the resource ran out around 2000.</p>

        <p>Increased scientific understanding of the role of nitrogen, phosphate, and other chemicals in agriculture stimulated a search for synthetic fertilizers. In the very early twentieth century, Fritz Haber, a professor at a German research university in Karlsruhe, developed methods for fixing nitrogen from the air. There would be many other developments in synthetic fertilizers and also pesticides and herbicides.</p>

        <p>As industrial capabilities expanded (chapter 24), a set of improved agricultural implements was developed. Better seed drills allowed seeds to be distributed evenly. Reapers allowed farmers to harvest a much more extensive crop than they could by hand. These implements were at first pulled by animals but would in the twentieth century be wedded to internal-combustion tractors.</p>

        <p>We mentioned advances in refrigeration above. There were other advances in food preservation. Napoleon had offered a prize for superior means of feeding an army on the move. The winner recognized that foods did not spoil if tightly sealed. A canning industry would develop with improved seals and coatings</p>

        <p class="page-num">1022</p>

        <p>that did not interfere with taste. Aided by Pasteur's understandings late in the century, it became increasingly possible to transport foods long distances and store them for months or years. (Freeze-drying from the early twentieth century had even better implications for the taste and texture of stored foods.) Although not strictly agricultural innovations, these developments had a significant effect on the quantity and variety of foods available to consumers.</p>

        <p>There were also important institutional developments. Large companies emerged to buy and transport agricultural goods. They sometimes engaged in production – as in the plantations run in tropical countries by fruit companies. Exchanges for commodity trading developed in several countries. Finally, the number of restaurants in the world proliferated as incomes rose and workers gained free time.</p>
