        <p><strong>Relationship to other chapters:</strong> This chapter connects to chapter 22 as both address the divergence in economic performance between Europe and the rest of the world in the nineteenth century. This chapter has a narrower temporal focus and looks at particular countries more than did chapter 22. As in chapter 22, it draws on many preceding discussions of economic growth, institutions, and other phenomena. The Industrial Revolution would have many impacts, but most obviously it would generate (almost) unprecedented rates of economic growth. The effects of the Industrial Revolution reverberate throughout the rest of the book, but most obviously when we address economic and technological developments in the twentieth century in chapter 29, and when we look at urbanization in chapter 31 and environmental issues in chapter 27. Economic growth would free humanity from Malthusian constraints but</p>

        <hr>

        <p>We trace in this chapter the spread of "industrial revolutions" across the globe. We shall see that the main characteristics of these revolutions are rapid technological innovation, the introduction of factories, and unprecedented (as far as we know) rates of economic growth. We will draw comparisons across states and regions to comprehend why industrial revolutions occurred in some places before others. We will also discuss how certain technologies, and the institution of the factory, built on what had gone before. Although we focus our attention on economy and technology, we will find that politics much influenced these, as did the environment (both natural and built), and culture. Later in the chapter, we will discuss effects on population and culture (and social structure).</p>

        <h2>The British Industrial Revolution</h2>

        <p>As we noted in chapter 22, there has been an unfortunate ideological element in discussions of the "Great Divergence." The same is unfortunately true of treatments of the British Industrial Revolution. We saw in chapter 22 that economic growth rates became much higher in the nineteenth century than they had (almost) ever been before. The world would be transformed by unprecedented economic growth in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with some regions of the world growing much faster than others. Some scholars view the British Industrial Revolution from 1750 as having triggered the nineteenth-century acceleration in growth rates, and as therefore being equivalent in importance to the Agricultural Revolution that we discussed back in chapter 4. Other scholars argue that nothing particularly noteworthy happened in Britain in the century after 1750. As in the broader "Great Divergence" debate, they wish to downplay the importance of any development unique to (part of) Europe.</p>

        <p>The reader should recall that the agricultural revolution occurred independently in many places. There were, that is, multiple agricultural revolutions. But the world had become much more interconnected by 1750. It may be (or not) that many countries were ready for an independent industrial revolution soon after 1750. However, all later industrializers would borrow ideas from the British directly or indirectly. If we accept that the Industrial Revolution was historically important, we must recognize that there was only one First Industrial Revolution. It is quite possible that later episodes of industrialization in other countries would not have occurred without the British example – just</p>

        <p>as the idea of agriculture spread geographically after the original agricultural revolutions.</p>

        <p>Arguments in favour of an important British Industrial Revolution generally point to three characteristics of the century after 1750 in Britain:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>The emergence of the modern factory.</em> There had of course been centralized workplaces previously in history: Shipbuilding and sugar refining and pottery kilns were among the industrial processes that required gathering many workers in one place. Moreover, rulers throughout the world had often advertised their wealth and encouraged the arts through workshops focused on luxury good production. However, in the decades after 1750 many British entrepreneurs gathered dozens or hundreds of workers together in one place to produce textiles or metal goods that for centuries had been produced in homes or small artisanal workshops. Such centralized workplaces would grow in importance over time, first in Britain and then throughout the world. We indeed tend to think in the twenty-first century that "industry" is something that happens in "factories." We should appreciate that this is instead a – revolutionary – transformation of the last centuries with its roots in mid-eighteenth-century Britain. Factories transformed the relationship between employers and employees, not to</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="page-num">1027</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">mention the lives of the working class and an emerging managerial class (chapter 23). Factory labour was generally, though not always, supervised, whereas workers in their own homes naturally were not. Among other things, workers (and managers) were now required to adhere to a strict schedule.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>An increase in the rate of technological innovation. This is of course somewhat harder to measure. It is easy to point to many significant technological innovations. The improved steam engine associated with James Watt in the 1780s would become over time a vital power source for both factories and transport. It would allow the development of railways and steamships in the early nineteenth century. There were a set of discoveries (and marketing plans) associated with Josiah Wedgwood from the 1770s that allowed the mass production of quality ceramics. Several innovations in textile spinning, weaving, dyeing, and printing from the 1770s dramatically lowered the cost while increasing the quality of first cotton and then woollen and linen textiles. A set of developments in the refining and processing of wrought iron and steel also lowered prices while increasing quality. There is also evidence from the British patent office of a general increase in innovative activity from about 1770. The rate of innovation would continue to expand globally over the next centuries. The British Industrial Revolution serves then as a watershed moment in human history. For most of the previous history of humanity (with perhaps rare exceptions such as Song China; chapter 15), technological innovation was rare enough that people generally died in a world that looked much like the world of their birth. The Industrial Revolution introduces the modern era where technological innovation is frequent, and we have come to expect major transformations in the world around us.<br><br></li>

            <li>An increase in economic growth rates. For Britain as a whole, economic growth of about 3 per cent per year became common after about 1820. If we focused our analysis on regions in which industry came to concentrate, such as Lancashire with its cotton mills, we would likely find increased economic growth rates in the later eighteenth century. As the ideas of the British Industrial Revolution spread to other lands, growth rates of 3 per cent or higher were observed at first in a handful of countries in the mid nineteenth century (see below); by the late twentieth century every country in the world had experienced at least some years of rapid economic growth. Global economic output would increase by eight times in the nineteenth century (versus perhaps five times in the previous millennium). Importantly, economic growth now occurred faster than population growth, and so the Malthusian population dynamics we first addressed in chapter 4 ceased to operate: Humans could now continually increase output per person. World population roughly doubled in the nineteenth century, a rate of growth that would have driven incomes below subsistence in preceding centuries but instead was dwarfed by economic growth. It is one of the ironies of history that Malthus expounded his</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="page-num">1028</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">theory in Britain just before economic growth accelerated. As with factories and technological innovation, the British Industrial Revolution stands as an inflection point between a human past in which economic growth was sluggish at best and a lengthy period of economic growth that has touched every corner of the world, albeit unequally.</p>

        <p>There were other interesting characteristics of the Industrial Revolution. As noted above, industrial activities became concentrated in particular regions: cotton in Lancashire, wool in Yorkshire, pottery in Staffordshire, many metal goods in the area around Birmingham (a small town in 1750 transformed within decades into a major industrial centre). In addition, specialized firms came increasingly to build industrial machinery rather than workers themselves making their own. We will address these characteristics briefly below. However, scholars have devoted most attention to explaining the three characteristics listed above.</p>

        <p>We should not move on without stressing that the Industrial Revolution was not without its costs. Early factories, and especially industrial cities, were heavily polluted. The average heights of the British fell in the early nineteenth century, indicating that they were suffering from disease or undernourishment or perhaps overwork as children. Many workers lost their jobs as machines replaced them. The standard of living of the average worker likely fell for a couple of decades before rising. Factories existed for decades before Parliament introduced basic health and safety regulations. It was well into the nineteenth century before unions were legalized to protest abuses of managerial power.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="page-num">1029</p>

        <p>As we shall see below, many workers came to perform one simple repetitive task: This sort of industrial boredom was fairly novel in history, but would become common worldwide in the next centuries.</p>

        <p class="page-num">1030</p>

        <h3>Relationships among factories, technology, and economic growth</h3>

        <p>It seems unlikely that the three key transformations identified above were unrelated. Historians have often argued that new technologies encouraged the development of factories. It was impracticable to place a steam engine or a giant spinning machine with hundreds of spindles into someone's home. This dynamic surely becomes important from the late eighteenth century, and remains important to this day: We associate industry with factories in large part because we think of large machines. However, the very earliest centralized workshops emerged from the 1750s, decades before the revolution in industrial machinery. They employed at first the same technology as was used in people's homes. Therefore, there must have been some other reason for factories (see below). Moreover, once these were in place, they encouraged technological innovation. Much of the innovation of the Industrial Revolution involves connecting machines together and attaching these to an external power source. Innovators were unlikely to develop factory technology when industry was pursued in workers' homes and workers powered their own machines. Once factories became common, innovators naturally turned their attention to technologies well suited to this new environment. These technologies would</p>

        </div>

        <p class="page-num">1031</p>

        <p>then further encourage the use of factories. We then have a dynamic where factories and innovation encourage each other.</p>

        <p>Factories and new technology then combined to increase industrial productivity. Increased productivity encouraged increased per capita incomes. However, this took a while: Factories emerge from the 1750s, and technological innovation accelerates from the 1770s, but per capita incomes rise only from the 1820s. Why does it take decades for factories and increased technological innovation to affect (our estimates of) British levels of per capita output? The main answer is that it took a long time for these ideas to spread. Steam engines provided less than one per cent of industrial power in Britain in 1800. The vast bulk of the industrial labour force still worked at home – though work at home increasingly supplied inputs to work in factories. Only as factories were built and new technologies adopted could per capita incomes rise. As noted above, this likely occurred well before 1820 in regions of industrial concentration. The fact that Britain was at war with France through much of the period of the French Revolution and Napoleon (1789–1815; see chapter 25) may also have served to delay the eventual increase in per capita incomes.</p>

        <p>Economic growth, once it began to accelerate, was self-reinforcing in important ways. Industrialists reinvested their profits into bigger factories and more complex technology. As we shall see, this would create a challenge for countries trying to catch up to Britain, for they had to leap to a much more expensive technology and more complex workplace environment.</p>

        <h3>Why? The European context</h3>

        <p>We discussed in Chapter 22 the timing and reasons for European economic divergence from Asia. If one thinks that Europe had developed better technologies or institutions or cultural attitudes before 1750, then the British Industrial Revolution likely owes much to these general European advantages. If one thinks instead that Europe only pulled ahead in the nineteenth century, then the British Industrial Revolution becomes potentially a cause more than an effect of the Great Divergence. We will not repeat the discussion of chapter 22 in this chapter</p>

        </div>

        <p class="page-num">1032</p>

        <p>but instead focus on Britain-specific influences on industrialization. We will note from time to time how these connect to issues discussed in chapter 22.</p>

        <p>We should stress, of course, that Britain and Europe did not operate in isolation from trends elsewhere in the world. In particular, we might note that Indian cottons and Chinese porcelain had established in the previous centuries that there was a large, growing market for these goods in particular, and consumer goods more generally. Josiah Wedgwood, the well-known pottery producer of the Industrial Revolution, was undoubtedly quite conscious of the Chinese example. It may be that Asian exemplars inspired many more British entrepreneurs. We also noted in chapter 18 that imports of coffee, tea, and cocoa may have inspired Europeans to work harder in order to afford such goods; imports of cotton and porcelain may have had a similar impact.</p>

        <h3>Politics and property rights</h3>

        <p>We have seen in chapter 21 that Britain was one of the first countries in the world in which an elected assembly with an extensive electorate gained authority over matters of taxation and law. Since landowners and merchants dominated Parliament, that body naturally stressed protection of property and adjudication of contract disputes. Such protections may have encouraged investments in factories and machines, as well as the internal and external trade that created markets for industrial products. Britain was also one of the first states to establish a patent office – but in practice, innovators during the Industrial Revolution often had great difficulty enforcing patent rights. When workers agitated against the adverse effect that some new technologies had on their jobs, Parliament strongly supported the rights of industrialists to employ whatever techniques they chose – fourteen workers were hanged in 1813 for destroying machines. Parliament only belatedly moved to limit child labour in factories. Autocratic governments elsewhere might have been far less enthused about such potentially destabilizing social change. Still, the legal situation of British industrialists may not have been that much better than elsewhere: As we have seen, autocrats could often provide reasonably secure property rights. Moreover, a century elapsed between the Glorious Revolution (in which Parliament solidified power) and Industrial Revolution. It is perhaps unlikely then that Parliamentary authority alone induced the Industrial Revolution.</p>

        <h3>The British Empire</h3>

        <p>We noted above that the developments observed in factories, technology, and economic growth were unlikely to be coincidental. We might apply the same argument to the twin facts that Britain industrializes while developing a vast global empire. In a World History text such as this, it is all too tempting to attribute the British Industrial Revolution to the British Empire. However, it proves difficult in practice to attribute the former to the latter. Most importantly, there is a timing problem: British expansion in the Americas long</p>

        <p class="page-num">1033</p>

        <p>preceded the Industrial Revolution, and Britain lost its major colonies there in the American Revolution (chapter 25) just as the Industrial Revolution was beginning. British expansion in Asia and especially Africa mostly occurred well after the Industrial Revolution. British superiority in steamships and weaponry was critical to this later imperialism: It is thus far easier to trace a connection from industrialization to empire than the reverse.</p>

        <p>One mechanism by which imperialism might have supported industrialization is through profits. Britons might have made extraordinary profits in the Empire and reinvested these in industry. While some Britons did make vast sums in the Empire, it is not clear that average returns were ever much, if at all, higher than investment returns at home or elsewhere in Europe. Moreover, those who invested abroad were not the same people that invested in industry: Industrial firms grew as profits in industry were reinvested. There may be an indirect link, though, if foreign profits were an important source of investment in the transport infrastructure that supported industrialization (see below).</p>

        <p>Foreign markets might also have been important. To be sure, Caribbean slave plantations provided a mass market for the least expensive textiles – cotton being preferred for working in the heat. Nevertheless, most early British industrialists sold the bulk of their output within Britain. Exports comprised less than 20 per cent of industrial production at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, though this figure rose to 40 per cent in 1800. (Cotton manufacturers benefited from British restrictions on the import of cotton cloth from India.) Likewise, industry obtained most raw materials locally. Britain imported iron ore in large quantities, but from Scandinavia rather than the Empire. Raw cotton</p>

        <div class="illustration-placeholder">

        <p class="page-num">1034</p>

        <p>was imported, and the cotton industry was the first to be transformed by new technology and factories. However, the primary source of cotton was the United States. Overall, foreign trade as a whole, within or beyond the Empire, accounted for just a few per cent of British economic activity.</p>

        <p>Food deserves special attention. As we have stressed throughout this book, societies can only support a sizeable non-agricultural population if they can feed these. Agricultural productivity did advance in Britain – though again more just before and after the Industrial Revolution than during, it seems. British farmers were able to focus increasingly on producing food since coal was replacing wood as a fuel and imported cotton substituted for local fibres such as wool. In the early decades of the Industrial Revolution, Britain provided most but far from all of the food needed by its industrial workforce. As the Industrial Revolution proceeded, Britain imported food in large amounts from Ireland and later from North America, Australia, and India. The Industrial Revolution would surely have slowed if not stopped but for this ability to import food. Note, though, that much of this food came from outside the Empire.</p>

        <h3>Transport</h3>

        <p>Ideally, we wish to identify a unique characteristic of Britain that itself changed in important ways just before or during the Industrial Revolution and that exerted clear influences on one or more of factories, innovation, and economic growth. One candidate here is the British internal transport system (the subject, the author confesses, of his PhD dissertation and first book). Recall that in the pre-railway era both land and water transport were important: Water transport was much less costly, but land transport was quicker, more reliable, and far more extensive (Box 5.3). In 1750, Britain had the best internal network of both roads and waterways in the world. This network had improved dramatically in the previous century. Parliament had approved hundreds of acts that allowed turnpike road, river improvement, and canal companies to do three critical things: expropriate land if necessary (with compensation decided by a jury if there was disagreement), borrow money to finance construction, and then charge tolls to pay off the debt and finance maintenance. By 1770 at the latest, England had a national network of roads suitable for wheeled traffic that linked virtually every town (recall that horses can pull several times as much in a wagon as they can carry on their backs). Navigable river mileage had doubled in the century before 1750; in succeeding decades, canals would link these rivers to connect major raw material deposits to industrial areas and urban markets. Autocratic governments elsewhere in the world hesitated to interfere with the landholdings of local elites. Ironically then, British confidence in property rights may have exerted their most significant effect by allowing forced confiscation of property. Governments elsewhere also struggled to finance infrastructure investment: Loans and then tolls instead funded British transport infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Turnpike trusts and river and canal companies all took a corporate form. Corporations were by this time familiar in Britain (Box 15.1). Yet families rather than corporations financed factories during the early Industrial Revolution. However, the widespread use of the corporate form in transport – which would continue with the more expensive railways – would set the stage for its later use in industry as the scale of industrial firms grew.</p>

        <p>With a national road network came a national system of "common carriers" so that industrialists could dispatch goods by wagon anywhere in the country. In the decades around 1750, entrepreneurs changed the way that they sold products. Rather than travelling between fairs and markets with goods loaded on packhorses, they came to send out either catalogues or sales representatives with samples, receive orders, and dispatch these by carrier. However, consumers or storeowners who order by sample expect to receive a good that is very similar to what they ordered. Standardized output was hard to achieve if workers each worked in their own homes. To take advantage of this new method of distributing their goods, then, entrepreneurs had a strong incentive to gather workers and supervise them. They also then had an incentive to mechanize production so that they could further standardize output.</p>

        <p>Transport improvements encouraged factories in other ways. If an employer did not receive raw materials on time, and his workers worked in their own</p>

        <p class="page-num">1036</p>

        <p>homes for piece rates (workers in their homes necessarily were paid for what they produced rather than by the hour), those workers just did something else with their time. Factory workers generally had to be paid no matter what. Due to the speed and reliability of the road network, industrialists need not hold large inventories to ensure regular production. As transport costs fell, entrepreneurs also used a more extensive range of materials in production: Belt buckles were adorned with various gemstones, for example. This increased the danger that workers would embezzle, but embezzlement was easier to prevent if workers were gathered and supervised. Increased travel – as stagecoach rides became both smoother and quicker – meant that national fashion tastes changed frequently; it was easier to respond to such changes if workers were collected and supervised. Lower transport costs also made it easier to feed a concentrated workforce, whether the food was domestic or foreign. This became particularly important as steam engines freed factories from the necessity of waterpower so that factories and workers could cluster in cities. Lower transport costs also allowed industrialists to serve a broad geographical market, and so expand their scale of output (though they might have satisfied this by leaving workers in their homes).</p>

        <p>Transport improvements also facilitated technological innovation in a variety of ways. Those smooth and fast stagecoaches encouraged innovators and entrepreneurs to communicate: It is clear that these did visit each other's establishments. We have often noted when discussing technology in this book that innovation is generally a collaborative effort. By facilitating collaboration, transport improvements facilitated innovation. There was also an indirect effect: Lower transport costs encouraged regional specialization. The wool industry of Yorkshire could only invade markets in other regions if Yorkshire goods could be transported there cheaply. Once a particular industry became concentrated in a specific region, it became easier for potential innovators not just to interact but also to appreciate the potential benefits of innovation. Regional specialization may have been especially important in the emergence of specialized machine manufacturers: It made sense to build machines for the woollen industry when surrounded by wool factories. Note that these machine-making firms had an obvious financial incentive to make steady improvements in the devices that they sold. Last but far from least, regional specialization allowed workers to specialize: Adam Smith, the founder of modern economics, would celebrate in 1776 a pin factory in which each worker performed one simple task among dozens, and recognized that this was only possible because the factory could serve an extensive market. Smith stressed that this "division of labour" lowered costs because workers became good at one thing and did not have to move between tasks. However, there was a further impact on innovation: Once workers came to perform just one task rather than many, it was much easier to see both the benefits and feasibility of mechanizing particular tasks.</p>

        <p class="page-num">1037</p>

        <p>In addition to indirect effects on economic growth via factories and technology, transport improvements had a direct impact on incomes by lowering the cost of moving goods to consumers. We have often seen in this book how increased trade benefited the masses. Recall how Roman peasants had better roof tiles and pottery than did post-Roman peasants (chapter 10). These benefits were important in the age of turnpike roads and canals, but they would expand further with the development of railways.</p>

        <p>Figure 24.1 is a detailed flowchart of the various ways that transport improvements influenced factories (captured as "Increased Scale of Production") and technological innovation. We outlined the four stages of technological innovation at the bottom in chapter 5.</p>

        <h3>Other factors</h3>

        <p>Scholars have long debated the causes of the Industrial Revolution. We can briefly appreciate several other factors that they have suggested as important:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>Britain had good supplies of coal and decent supplies of iron ore.</em> This raw material abundance was undoubtedly helpful. Yet Britain would import large amounts of iron ore and all of the cotton for its cotton factories. Many other countries also had substantial coal and iron ore resources. These were of little value unless accessible by (especially) water transport. China certainly had coal and iron ore (though perhaps not as fortuitously situated), but had not developed the same access to these (chapter 22). Some have suggested that Britain had to utilize coal because of a wood shortage. It then benefited from a resource disadvantage, since coal turned out to have greater technological potential in iron manufacture. However, Britain's encroachment on forestland was similar to that in many other countries (including China). Moreover, a wood shortage might be an effect of earlier industrialization. In any case, coal would come to power steam engines and then be a major source of mechanical energy as well as a source of heating. Indeed, in the nineteenth century, coal would provide mechanical power to British and world industry at levels many times that ever achieved by wind and water power; humans ceased to rely on renewable energy sources but became dependent upon non-renewable energy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="page-num">1039</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Some scholars would emphasize this increased reliance on non-renewable energy as a vital characteristic of the Industrial Revolution, stressing the role played by non-renewable energy sources in increasing average incomes.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Many of the early industrial workers were single women and children. These were less expensive than men. Social relations and cultural attitudes that allowed women and children to work outside the home aided industrialization, though perhaps to a limited degree.</li>
            <li>The direct influence of science on the technology of the time was limited. Advances in iron manufacture occurred through trial and error with a limited understanding of the chemical reactions involved. The scientific understanding of vacuums may have aided steam engine technology, but that understanding was centuries old. However, there may have been a critical indirect effect through the adoption of the scientific method. As we saw in chapter 22, European scientists had come in previous centuries to stress careful experimentation or observation, and especially the careful recording of observations. The technological innovations of the Industrial Revolution period also generally involved an extensive trial-and-error process in which different "recipes" for iron refining or pottery kilns were tried and the results carefully recorded, or slightly different designs of textile machinery carefully evaluated. Though technological innovation historically has generally proceeded through trial and error, the innovators of the Industrial Revolution were likely more careful in their practice. European scientists interacted with technological innovators. The French Royal Society of scientists published an extensive multi-volume encyclopedia of industrial technologies with the explicit goal of encouraging improvement. In Britain, innovators such as James Watt mingled with scientists in societies that promoted the scientific method.</li>
            <li>Britain had become a more flexible society socially than many in the world, though likely not the most flexible. Successful industrialists could buy land and be accepted into the rural aristocracy. The children of aristocrats would seek industrialists' children as marriage partners. The son of the cotton manufacturer Robert Peel would become Prime Minister. While it was useful that there were social rewards for wealth obtained in any manner, it was less wonderful that some successful industrialists devoted their profits to land rather than industry.</li>
            <li>Some have argued that Britain had developed a system of apprenticeship that meant that British industrialists had more and better skilled workers to draw upon.</li>
            <li>Britain had not been successfully invaded since 1066. Though it had experienced civil wars, it could nevertheless be that entrepreneurs were more willing to invest in factories there than in lands often ravaged by warfare.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The second generation of industrializers</h2>

        <p>The British attempted to ban the export of industrial technology. However, these efforts barely slowed the spread of technology to other lands. Within a few decades, textile industries throughout the world would adopt new spinning and weaving machinery. Railways were built on all continents within decades of their invention in Britain. Movement of people was generally necessary for the successful transmission of technology: It was not enough to send blueprints and instructions. Many British entrepreneurs moved to other countries, and other countries sent spies into Britain.</p>

        <p>The new technology affected four countries most profoundly in the middle decades of the nineteenth century: France, Belgium, and Germany in Europe, and the United States of America. These countries also experienced rapid economic growth. These were each countries with close economic ties to Britain – but the same was true of Portugal or much of Scandinavia, whose performance was less impressive at the time. Each of these four countries had significant coal deposits (which were soon reached by railway or water transport where this did not already exist) – but again many countries with coal failed to achieve much industrialization at the time. Industrialization in both France and Germany concentrated in the coalfield that spanned northeastern France, Belgium, and western Germany. (Note that we speak of Germany as a country for convenience here; we saw in chapter 21 that Germany was unified only in 1871.)</p>

        <p class="page-num">1041</p>

        </div>

        <p>Railways were an important part of the story of economic growth in these countries. To be sure, the cost savings over water transport where this was feasible could be moderate. However, railways combined low cost with speed and reliability, and railways could be built almost anywhere. Railways opened vast swathes of the interior of the United States. Railways accelerated the dynamic effects associated above with earlier advances in roads and waterways. By expanding market size, railways encouraged the development of large industrial establishments. Travelling salespeople became even more common, increasing the need for standardization of industrial output. Industrialists became even more confident of their ability to obtain supplies in a timely fashion, further tempting them to gather workers together. Railways also directly stimulated local iron industries with their demand for rails and railway locomotives and cars.</p>

        <p>There were notable differences among these four countries. Growth in both population and per capita incomes occurred much faster in Germany than France over most of the nineteenth century. The French outnumbered the Germans at the time of Napoleon and likely had higher incomes; the Germans far outnumbered the French by 1900 and had higher incomes and a much bigger iron industry. Many commentators in France and elsewhere worried about the potential repercussions of this change in the balance of power in Europe. It would certainly play a role in fostering the world wars of the twentieth century (chapter 28). One characteristic of German development was the early</p>

        <p>appearance of investment banks: banks willing to make longer-term loans than merchants had required in the past. These became closely associated with large industrial concerns in some but not all industries. Large family firms instead dominated French industry: These were arguably conservative in investment strategies (lest risky expansion wipe out the family fortune) and perhaps less competently managed because of the emphasis on family. Economic historians hotly debate the quantitative importance of these institutional differences.</p>

        <p>The United States would gain fame for the "American System of Manufactures." This was in turn associated with the idea of "interchangeable parts." The parts of a gun might be manufactured so precisely, for example, that the handle from one would fit flawlessly with the barrel from another. This precision mainly reflected mechanization: Lathes, for instance, could achieve standardization that work by hand could not. We have discussed the incentives for standardization above. Why did manufacturers in the United States push this farther and faster (on average, it should be stressed) than those in Europe?</p>

        <p class="page-num">1043</p>

        <p>Higher wages in the United States – the availability of free land encouraged high wages – may have encouraged mechanization. Nevertheless, the abundance of raw materials may have been of even greater importance: Lathes and other machines were far more wasteful of wood and metal than was hand production.</p>

        <h2>The Second Industrial Revolution</h2>

        <p>A set of significant innovations in the 1870s and 1880s has been widely termed the Second Industrial Revolution. Though less "revolutionary" than the First Industrial Revolution, it is nevertheless true that the vast bulk of technological innovation since the 1880s has built on the technologies of the Second Industrial Revolution.</p>

        <p>There are three critical areas of innovation in the Second Industrial Revolution. One is internal combustion. Internal-combustion engines were first developed in Germany, and were utilized as industrial power sources from the 1880s. Innovators would explore new uses for these in locomotion after that: Internal combustion provided much greater power per unit of weight than steam engines ever could.</p>

        <div class="illustration-placeholder">

        </div>

        <p class="page-num">1045</p>

        <p>A second area involved the harnessing of electricity. Electricity had received considerable scientific attention in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Only in the 1880s, though, was electricity commercialized. The crucial development here occurred in New York: Thomas Edison developed systems for generating, transmitting, and metering electricity, and a practical light bulb that would be the first major application of electric power. He established a profitable company that allowed New York homes, offices, and factories to have a cleaner and more reliable source of lighting than gas lighting could provide. Once such a system was in place, innovators developed a variety of other applications for electricity.</p>

        <p>The third area was chemicals. There had been important advances in dyeing and bleaching during the First Industrial Revolution, but these had occurred by trial and error. By the late nineteenth century, industrial chemists could draw upon a much greater scientific understanding of chemical reactions. The immediate result was a range of superior and inexpensive synthetic dyes that would replace a set of natural dyes employed for centuries or millennia. Then developments in pharmaceuticals began to follow. The stage was set for synthetic fibres and plastics in the twentieth century (we will trace how the Second Industrial Revolution unfolded in the early twentieth century in chapter 29). Germany and the United States were the early leaders in this new chemical industry.</p>

        <p>Some scholars would also include steel-making in discussions of the Second Industrial Revolution. Steel had been produced for thousands of years, but it had always been very expensive. We now know that steel is a compound of iron with about a 2 per cent carbon content. This compound is harder and carries an edge better than iron itself. Soldiers had long prized steel for swords, but it had generally been too expensive for agricultural implements. Advances during the First Industrial Revolution had extended the uses of steel somewhat, but steel-makers still transformed iron in small batches. Only in the late nineteenth century did it become possible to produce steel directly from iron ore in large furnaces. Bessemer achieved success in Britain, but the technology soon spread globally – though it had to be adapted to the chemical composition of different ores.</p>

        <p>Were there commonalities across the three or four areas of the Second Industrial Revolution? One commonality was size: These new technologies generally required much larger industrial establishments than those of the early First Industrial Revolution. They only made sense in an era of massive industrial establishments – which were usually though not always run by corporations. A second commonality was science. Advances in both electrification and chemicals relied heavily on advances in scientific understanding over the preceding century. Innovation still involved a costly process of experimentation (Edison and his associates spent years developing filaments for light bulbs), but science provided useful directions to experimenters and identified possibilities. Increased understandings of chemical reactions also aided advances in steelmaking, though to a lesser extent; scientists would struggle to explain after the fact why certain smelting technologies worked on some ores but not others.</p>

        <p class="page-num">1046</p>

        <p>Internal-combustion technology benefited from an increased understanding of combustion. The coincidental timing of these three or four different types of innovation might then in part be attributed to the development of institutions for financing and organizing large industrial establishments, and in part to advances in science resulting from the Scientific Revolution (chapter 22) and the research university (chapter 23).</p>

        <p>We saw above that the technology of the First Industrial Revolution was closely associated with the factory. For the Second Industrial Revolution, the institutional counterpart was the industrial research laboratory. Through most of human history, innovators had usually operated on a small scale: They worked away in their own private homes or workshops, though they networked with others. Large firms, seeking new products and processes, and recognizing the importance of both science and careful experimentation, came during the Second Industrial Revolution to establish research facilities (chapter 23). These facilities were generally interdisciplinary: They employed a mix of scientists, engineers, and technicians. Edison's research laboratory would not only continue to develop his integrated system but would be responsible for the first</p>

        <p>phonographs and moving pictures. Chemical firms such as Bayer in Germany and DuPont in the United States would investigate a range of new chemical possibilities. Managers would struggle to figure out how to manage the inherently unpredictable process of technological innovation. Industrial research laboratories would grow in size and extent over the next century, and are probably responsible in the early twenty-first century for over half of the technological innovation in the world – but an important place remains for the independent innovator in at least some sectors of the economy.</p>

        <h2>The third generation of industrializers</h2>

        <p>In the last decades before the First World War, many more countries experienced rapid rates of economic growth. Most European countries – including Russia – can be included in this group, as well as Canada, Australia, Argentina, and Japan. Almost all countries of the world experienced some growth in per capita incomes, but at far lower rates than among the first three generations of industrializers. The result, then, was that Europe and European settler economies on average achieved per capita incomes several times those of most countries in Asia or Africa by 1914. This is the most dramatic period of the Great Divergence that we sought to comprehend in chapter 22. The glaring exception to the Great Divergence was Japan, which alone among Asian states managed to achieve similar growth rates to those in Europe. The Japanese exception shows that a close cultural bond with Europe was not essential to economic growth in this period – but the fact that Japan was an exception suggests that it was not easy for countries to industrialize without strong connections to Europe. Of course, Japan differed from much though not all of the rest of Asia by not being colonized; this allowed it to pursue independent economic policies.</p>

        <p>Second-generation industrializers had consciously sought to "catch up" to Britain. Third-generation industrializers had a different option. At least potentially, they could latch on to the new technologies of the Second Industrial Revolution at their inception. This may have been especially important for countries with little coal but abundant hydroelectric power potential, including Japan and (especially northern) Italy. Japan would be one of the earliest adopters of electricity, and would become a world leader in the development of electric railway systems for its growing cities. Italy would be the home of one of the first successful automobile manufacturers. Nevertheless, the industries of the First Industrial Revolution remained important: Japan would develop extensive textile manufacture, for example. Railway construction continued to be an important characteristic of economic development.</p>

        <p>The Russian state was heavily involved in industrialization. It focused its efforts on both railway construction and the development of steel mills. There was only 1,000 kilometres of railway in Russia in 1860 but 58,000 by 1900. The 9,000-kilometre Trans-Siberian railway was completed in 1904 – just decades after transcontinental railways spanned the much shorter distances across the</p>

        <p class="page-num">1048</p>

        <p>United States and Canada. The Trans-Siberian crossed parts of Manchuria controlled by Russia at the time. Russia taxed the peasantry heavily to finance these investments. The early Soviet Union would continue these policies in its first decades after the Russian Revolution of 1917. Though the actions of the Russian and Soviet states reflect a long history of autocracy in Russia (chapter 21), they also reflect the challenges of being a late industrializer. Firms in Britain had often expanded slowly by reinvesting profits. Later industrializers struggled to finance much bigger factories than those of the early First Industrial Revolution. Russia lacked firms and financial institutions that could readily build railways or steel mills without state support. Russia also invested in education, and in a legal system to support commerce, but provided no political rights or social policies for the growing industrial workforce.</p>

        <p>India had readily adopted in the early nineteenth century the technological advances in iron production associated with the First Industrial Revolution. However, as the scale – and scientific content – of iron technology advanced in the late nineteenth century, the Indian iron industry fell behind. There was only one modern steel mill in India in 1913 (and only one in China and none in Africa). India would nevertheless embrace railway technology. The British had feared that this new technology might offend traditionalists, but there was little objection. Indeed, this was a general outcome in the world: There were some objections to the noise, pollution, and economic transformation associated with railways (Ecuador's government forcefully resisted protests in the late nineteenth century), but in general, people welcomed railways for the ease of movement of both goods and people that they provided.</p>

        <p>The American Admiral Perry had forced the reclusive Japanese state to open itself to international trade in 1853. The Meiji Restoration of 1868, which ended the power of autocratic shoguns in favour of the emperor and an</p>

        <p>elite-dominated legislature, was in large part guided by a desire to pursue industrialization to match Western military might. The Japanese invested heavily in education and sent numerous students abroad to learn the latest science and technology. It also invested heavily in railways. The success of Japanese industrialization and technological borrowing would be reflected not only in rapid economic growth but in a naval defeat of Russia in 1905 (they had come into conflict in Manchuria). Though Russia was one of the least economically advanced European nations, and had to send its navy halfway around the world to fight the Japanese, the defeat of a European navy by an Asian navy was still a surprise to many observers. (Not everyone was surprised: The American writer Mencken predicted a Japanese victory while the Russian fleet was on its way.) The Japanese victory encouraged opponents of colonization, especially elsewhere in Asia. At the same time, it increased pressure for political change in Russia.</p>

        <h2>Demographic changes associated with industrialization</h2>

        <p>These industrial revolutions had far-reaching demographic implications. New machines and fertilizers increased agricultural output, while steamships and railways made it easier to move food between continents. The population of Europe would rise from 105 million in 1700 to 390 million in 1900. There were even more dramatic increases in population in the Americas. The population there grew from 13 to 145 million over the same period, reflecting both high birth rates and the migration of 50 million (chapter 31), mostly from Europe (making Europe's population growth even more astonishing). Mortality rates fell in Europe as nutrition improved and as certain diseases like cholera were tackled by the provision of clean drinking water to urban populations (advances in medical knowledge and pharmaceuticals had a limited impact before the twentieth century; again see chapter 31). Birth rates soared as young people were enabled to get a job and form families earlier. The average marriage age in Britain fell from 30 in the seventeenth century to 23 in 1800. Though premarital sex was far more common than we might think – British records show that one-fifth of British brides were pregnant before 1700 and two-fifths after – birth rates were far higher among the married.</p>

        <p>This population growth would slow in the late nineteenth century, and birth rates would fall to or below replacement rates (that is, the level of about 2.1 births per adult woman that is required to maintain a stable population through time) in the twentieth century in most developed countries, including Japan. Just as with rapid economic growth (above), Malthus had not foreseen such a transformation. Throughout human history, increases in incomes had induced increases in population. Yet as incomes continued to rise – and at unprecedented rates – most people decided to have smaller families. Historians</p>

        </div>

        <p>have described this experience of first rapid population growth followed by low fertility and population stability or decline as the "demographic transition."</p>

        <p>Why did fertility fall despite rising incomes? The likely answer reflects a handful of changes associated with industrialization. One such transformation was urbanization. The steam engine freed industrialists from locating near sources of water power. They found it convenient to cluster in towns or cities where they could share access to workers, suppliers, machine repair specialists, financial institutions, and eventually advertisers. The railway and steamship meant that it was easier to feed urban populations than ever before. As agricultural productivity expanded through the nineteenth century, more and more of the population became urban. Britain had shown the way: About half of its population was urban already in the late eighteenth century. On farms, there are many useful tasks that small children can perform (as my mother never ceased to remind me as a child). Workers in their own homes could also have their children perform useful tasks such as sweeping debris or loading thread. The earliest factories employed child labour – often, entire families worked as a unit – but the British banned such labour, and many other industrializing nations never allowed it. Child labour would peak in the United States in the 1910s and then decline sharply. Therefore, for urban industrial families, children were far more expensive than for rural families: They were a net cost rather than a contributor to family production.</p>

        <p>Moreover, these families had other things on which to spend their income. We have recorded a slow increase in average incomes through much of world</p>

        <p class="page-num">1051</p>

        <p>history. Nevertheless, in 1700 the typical European family still had a meagre set of personal belongings: one or two changes of clothing, some pottery, and so on. Dramatic improvements in industrial productivity exposed the working class to a range of new consumption opportunities: They could eat off nice plates, and wear comfortable and colourful cottons. There was a corresponding change in attitudes from focusing on subsistence to becoming "consumers." We saw in chapter 22 that farmers and workers were increasing their non-food consumption in most of the world before 1800. The widespread purchase of many non-food items then accelerated as real incomes rose in the nineteenth century.</p>

        <p>The cost of raising children increased as systems of public education expanded. The First Industrial Revolution had not required a very educated workforce. As technology became more complex over the nineteenth century and firms grew in size and complexity – and especially with the Second Industrial Revolution – industrialists and workers both urged governments to provide education. This was one area in which Japan after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 sought to duplicate Western efforts: The state mandated primary education for both boys and girls from 1872. Workers who could read instructions and perform basic mathematical calculations were far more productive. Also, there was an increased demand for advanced training in science, engineering, and management itself. The enhanced value of education may have given some advantage to Protestant countries within Europe: Children had often learned to read there so that they could read the Bible. This tradition of literacy may be the primary reason why Scandinavian countries would grow faster than most countries within the third generation of industrializers. In any case, once states came to require that children go to school, and as average years in school steadily expanded, children became ever more a cost rather than a potential revenue source.</p>

        <p>Before the Industrial Revolutions, most children had tended to follow their parents' occupations. Most people were farmers, and their children would become farmers. Artisans would often train their children as artisans. Industrialization broke this link for many: Children would no longer inherit a family farm, and no longer work beside their parents. They would instead seek their own jobs as they grew into adulthood. This fact had temporarily caused birth rates to rise in many countries as children left home and married early. The longer-term effect was to cause parents to worry about their children's future. They could no longer teach them how to farm or spin while working but had to encourage children not just to attend school but pay attention and prepare for some occupation. This task became even more challenging as industrialization created a dizzying array of new occupations: managers, technicians, railway workers. Parents might reasonably decide to have fewer children and help them with their homework (or later pay for tutors) – especially if the parents themselves were educated. They were tempted, that is, to emphasize child quality over quantity.</p>

        <p>Children had long been useful not just when they were young but again later when parents were old. Children were, through most of human history, the pension plans of the elderly. People too old to maintain themselves were reliant on their children for support. With industrialization, workers were able to save for retirement. Financial instruments were developed to facilitate this over time (see Box 15.1). In the nineteenth and especially twentieth centuries, firms and governments developed pension plans. Germany was a leader here, seeing the provision of social policies such as state pensions as a way of satisfying urban workers without extending political power to these. Many other countries would not provide state pensions until the Great Depression or early postwar period (chapter 29). In any case, as opportunities to self-finance one's retirement increased, the importance of having children declined.</p>

        <p>Parents desirous of having children to look after them in their old age had long had to worry about high rates of infant and child mortality. Through most of human history, between a quarter and a half of babies would die before reaching adulthood. The decreases in mortality noted above were concentrated in childhood: Better nutrition of mothers and children, and the decreased incidence of disease, combined to reduce rates of infant and child mortality dramatically. It is now a tragedy in rich countries when a child dies; mere centuries ago it was just a part of life everywhere. One result of declining child mortality was that parents determined to have a couple of children around in their old age might have three rather than seven.</p>

        <p>For a variety of reasons related to industrialization, then, the cost of having children rose while the benefits of doing so fell. There was also, in most countries, an important change in the power relations within families. As women gained employment opportunities in industry, and then gained educations, they gained power both to choose marriage partners and to exercise authority within a marriage. Since women bear the costs of pregnancy and breastfeeding,</p>

        <p class="page-num">1053</p>

        <p>they likely on average evaluate the costs and benefits of children differently from men. Increased female influence within families likely encouraged smaller families.</p>

        <p>Of course, the will to have fewer children needed to be coupled with the ability to achieve that end. It is important to appreciate that the demographic transition began at a time when birth control technologies were still quite limited. Primitive condoms made of animal intestines were known from at least the sixteenth century in Europe (seemingly earlier in China, and there is debate as to whether they were known in ancient societies). Linen condoms treated with chemicals were popular in the eighteenth century, condoms made from rubber appeared in 1855, and the first latex condoms emerged in the 1920s: These were both cheaper and more comfortable. Diaphragms were invented and improved from the 1860s. It is likely, though, that women bore the greatest responsibility for birth control and relied on a variety of natural substances such as moss to prevent insemination well into the twentieth century. Accurate knowledge of the female menstrual cycle, and thus that sex was riskier at some times than others, spread from the middle decades of the nineteenth century. As millions of observant Catholics can attest, timing sexual intercourse is an error-prone method of birth control at the level of families, but it can have a significant impact on societal birth rates if pursued by an entire population. Doctors had (correctly) advocated breastfeeding since at least the sixteenth century to reduce the chances of pregnancy. Of course, couples could abstain if determined not to have more children. Religious leaders often opposed contraception, but were often ignored. (The pope decreed that the fetus had a soul at the moment of conception in 1869, against centuries of thinking that the soul entered the fetus three months later; this decision would shape debates over abortion in succeeding centuries.)</p>

        <p>The demographic experience of the first three generations of industrializers was duplicated elsewhere in the twentieth century as industrialization and economic growth spread. Europe had largely completed the demographic transition by 1914 while most of Africa and Asia was just beginning. However, the fall in mortality in Asia and Africa would be much more dramatic as developments in medical understanding and pharmaceuticals advanced. Mortality rates in India fell from 5 per cent in 1900 to 2.7 per cent in 1950 to 1.5 per cent in 1970. Much of the world, therefore, experienced dramatic population growth in the twentieth century. India's population grew from 100 million in 1700 to about 300 million in 1900, but then grew to exceed 1.2 billion by 2015. Estimates of the population of China place it at approximately 150–200 million in 1700, and 400 million in 1900; it exceeded 1.35 billion by 2015. In the 1970s there was widespread concern that population growth would outstrip the earth's carrying capacity: We can only feed so many, even with advanced agricultural technology. However, birth rates in most of the world have fallen toward replacement rates in recent decades. The population will continue to grow in countries such as India just because they have young populations at or entering prime childbearing years. And some</p>

        <p>Islamic and African countries have not seen birth rates fall so far – likely in large part because women there are less educated, have lower labour force participation, and are less influential within families. The earth's population will continue to rise for decades but may level off before the end of the twenty-first century. Many countries, including Japan, are indeed grappling with the somewhat novel challenges of population decline and population ageing.</p>

        <p>The changes above also affected how children were treated. We noted in chapter 4 that strict child discipline was the norm in agricultural societies – though younger children especially had some latitude for play. Industrialization and urbanization, and especially the extension of public education, meant that childhood became a more protracted process in which children operated much of the time separately from parents and were engaged in different pursuits from adults. When children were at home, parents could lavish more attention on them because they had fewer children and these were less likely to die. The</p>

        <p>general cultural outcome was to rethink the nature of childhood. Rather than urging children to behave like adults, adults recognized childhood and adolescence as special periods of personality development. Parents increasingly treated children with both affection and respect. Governments, which through most of human history had left childrearing to families (bestowing complete authority on parents, except in the societally important area of inheritance), began to intercede by providing education, legislating against child labour, and eventually (usually well into the twentieth century) even placing limits on corporal punishment by parents. Less happily, a set of childhood mental challenges, including what we now call attention deficit disorder, anorexia, and depression, received scientific attention from the nineteenth century. Though it is hard to say for sure, these mental challenges appear to have become more prevalent in the modern era.</p>

        <h2>Social and cultural changes associated with industrialization</h2>

        <p>We have touched on some critical social changes already: urbanization, education, and changing relationships between both men and women, and parents and children. We mentioned above another important transformation between employers and employees in that the former increasingly came to supervise the latter. We discussed the growth of both the working class and middle class in chapter 23.</p>

        <p>One other noteworthy social transformation in the nineteenth century was that standards of attire converged across both classes and nations. Convergence is first observable among middle-class men, but working-class men and upper-class men then came to dress much like middle-class men. This transformation was generally a voluntary response to the increased availability of mass-produced clothing and a shared aspiration toward clothing that seemed "modern," and at least somewhat comfortable. However, colonial governments encouraged Western attire among bureaucrats. The modernizing Meiji government in Japan in 1894 ordered bureaucrats to wear Western clothing. Women's fashion displayed far more regional diversity, but here too there was marked convergence in styles of dress across classes and countries. The typical practice by which women in tropical countries did not cover their breasts largely disappeared because of missionary preaching, gawking tourists, and the more general convergence in attire. Within countries, the decreased ability to identify someone's class by their clothing served to lessen class identification and conflict. Though Western fashion was most widely adopted, especially among men, the shawl and kimono – but not the sari – were adopted by many Western women in the late nineteenth century in rejection of less comfortable Western clothing.</p>

        <p>Industrialization – and the political changes associated with the rise of the nation state (chapter 21) – caused people around the world to reflect on change.</p>

        <p>Many began to consider the possibility that there was progress in human societies, an idea only intermittently espoused before. In Europe, such ideas were often associated with a sense that Europe was more progressive than other places, and speculation on whether others could or would catch up. Everywhere, such ideas caused many to question inherited traditions that had failed to predict these changes and often seemed not to accord well with these new realities. These ideas of human progress would be crushed in much of the world by the horrors of the world wars (chapter 28) and the Great Depression (chapter 29) but would be revived in the postwar era – with less ethnocentrism. To a lesser but significant degree, many people in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries also came to doubt that there was progress in human affairs. We will in chapter 32 explore whether it makes sense to speak of human progress.</p>
