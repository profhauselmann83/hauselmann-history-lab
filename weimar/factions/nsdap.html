                <h4>⚠️ Currently Marginal - But Growing</h4>
                <p>With only 12 seats (2.4% of the vote) in 1928, mostly limited to Bavaria, the NSDAP is a <strong>radical fringe with no real ability to influence Germany's future</strong>.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Or so most Germans believe.</strong></p>
                
                <p>But the party has reason for optimism:</p>

                    <li>Mussolini in Italy serves as a model for fascist success</li>

                    <li>Great Depression makes many wonder if Germany needs radical solutions</li>

        <!-- IDEOLOGY -->
        <section id="ideology">
            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            
            <p>The NSDAP belongs to an entirely new type of ideology—a <strong>racialized version of the fascism of Italy's Benito Mussolini</strong>. We initially attracted followers of the far-right völkisch nationalist milieu and the anticommunist Freikorps paramilitary culture.</p>
            
            <p>Unlike traditional conservatives, however, the NSDAP appeals to the working class. Our left wing employs <strong>anti–big business, antibourgeois, and anticapitalist rhetoric</strong>. Yet, after a failed coup in 1923, and no discernible inroads into the Marxist parties' supporters, the NSDAP recently began downplaying its anticapitalism to gain the support of elites and the middle class.</p>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>What Makes Us Different</h4>
                <p>Now, a <strong>chauvinistic revanchist nationalism stressing antisemitism blends with anti-Marxist themes</strong>. We relentlessly denounce everything related to defeat in 1918—Marxism, the Republic, the Treaty of Versailles. We call for the execution of the November criminals.</p>
                
                <p><strong>We claim to stand above party politics</strong>—the NSDAP does not even like to call itself a party, likening itself instead to a <strong>"national movement."</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>The Führer Principle</h4>
                <p>At the top of the NSDAP is the <strong>führer</strong>, war veteran Adolf Hitler, who ostensibly holds full command over the party. Unlike other parties with internal democracy, we follow the <strong>Führerprinzip</strong> (Leader Principle):</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Absolute authority flows from Hitler downward</strong></li>
                    <li>No votes, no debates - Hitler decides</li>
                    <li>Each level of organization has its own führer who commands those below</li>
                    <li>Unity of command prevents the chaos of parliamentary democracy</li>
                    <li>The führer embodies the will of the Volk (people)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>Adolf Hitler's Legal Status</h4>
                <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Hitler is not a German citizen. He was born in Austria-Hungary, though he fought in the German army in the war and renounced his Austrian citizenship in 1925. He is technically <strong>stateless</strong>.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Legal consequences:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cannot sit in the Reichstag</li>
                    <li>Cannot run for president</li>
                    <li>CAN be appointed chancellor (loophole: chancellor need not be citizen or Reichstag member)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>The Legality Strategy</h4>
                <p>After the failed Munich Putsch (1923), we adopted a strategy of <strong>"legality"</strong>:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Official policy:</strong> Disavow violent revolution; pursue power through elections</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice:</strong> SA continues street violence but "unofficially"</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Use democracy to destroy democracy from within</li>
                    <li><strong>Hitler's promise:</strong> "We will enter legal organizations and make our party a factor. When we have the numbers, we will legally possess the constitutional right to overthrow the existing order."</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Translation:</strong> We'll use the Republic's rules to gain power, then abolish those rules once we're in control.</p>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Racial Antisemitism (Biological)</h4>
                <p>Jews are not a religion or culture—they are a <strong>biologically destructive race</strong>. This is the core of our ideology:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Jews are a parasitic race</strong> that lives off host nations</li>
                    <li><strong>Cannot assimilate:</strong> Jewishness is genetic, unchangeable</li>
                    <li><strong>International Jewish conspiracy:</strong> Control finance, Marxism, democracy, media</li>
                    <li><strong>Racial pollution:</strong> Jews "contaminate" German blood through intermarriage</li>
                    <li><strong>November criminals:</strong> Jews orchestrated the "stab in the back" that lost the war</li>
                    <li><strong>The "Jewish Question" requires a racial solution:</strong> Removal from German society</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><em>Note: This differs from DNVP's cultural antisemitism, which allows assimilation. We see Jews as biologically unchangeable enemies.</em></p>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Völkisch Nationalism</h4>
                <p>Germany is defined by <strong>blood and soil (Blut und Boden)</strong>, not citizenship:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Volk:</strong> A racial community of ethnic Germans</li>

                <h4>Destruction of Versailles</h4>

                <ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Marx was a Jew:</strong> Communism is Jewish ideology</li>

                <h4>"Socialism" in National Socialism</h4>
                <p>Our "socialism" is <strong>not Marxist class conflict</strong>. It means:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>National community (Volksgemeinschaft):</strong> Classless racial unity</li>

                    <li><strong>Labor dignity:</strong> Workers valued but controlled</li>
                    <li><strong>Anti-capitalist rhetoric (for workers):</strong> Attack "Jewish finance capital"</li>

                    <li><strong>Left wing:</strong> Provides mass appeal to workers; energizes SA street fighters</li>

                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>His solution:</strong> Ambiguity. Use socialist rhetoric publicly while promising capitalists privately that property rights will be safe. Focus on what unites both wings: antisemitism, nationalism, anti-Marxism.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Long-term:</strong> Once in power, Hitler will likely purge the left wing (Strasser faction) to consolidate elite support.</p>

                <h4>Immediate Goals (1929-1932)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Massive electoral growth:</strong> From 2.4% to 20%+ (exploit economic crisis)</li>
                    <li><strong>Win middle class:</strong> Downplay socialism, emphasize anti-Marxism and order</li>
                    <li><strong>Win farmers:</strong> Debt relief, anti-Semitic scapegoating, "blood and soil"</li>
                    <li><strong>Legitimacy through DNVP alliance:</strong> Young Plan campaign makes us "respectable"</li>
                    <li><strong>Destabilize Republic:</strong> Street violence, parliamentary obstruction, create chaos</li>
                    <li><strong>Build SA:</strong> Expand paramilitary to dominate streets</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal path to power:</strong> Win elections, then destroy democracy from within</li>

                    <li><strong>Seize total power:</strong> Hitler as dictator (Führer und Reichskanzler)</li>

                    <li><strong>Rearm Germany:</strong> Rebuild military for expansion</li>
                    <li><strong>Lebensraum:</strong> Conquer territory in Eastern Europe</li>
                    <li><strong>Racial state:</strong> Society organized by blood, not class or citizenship</li>
                    <li><strong>Thousand Year Reich:</strong> Permanent Nazi empire</li>

            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>⚠️ Legal Facade, Violent Reality</h4>
                <p><strong>Official policy ("legality strategy"):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pursue power through elections</li>
                    <li>Disavow revolutionary violence</li>
                    <li>Promise to work within constitutional framework</li>
                    <li>Hitler: "We will come to power legally"</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Actual practice:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SA continues street violence ("unofficially")</li>
                    <li>Disrupt opponent rallies, beat communists, intimidate voters</li>
                    <li>Hitler winks at violence while publicly condemning it</li>
                    <li>Goal: Use legality to gain power, then abolish legality</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>"Legality" is a tactic, not a principle. Once we have power, the constitution becomes irrelevant.</strong></p>

            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>The Legality Strategy</h4>
                <p><strong>You must maintain the facade of legality while using violence strategically.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>In the Reichstag:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give fiery speeches but don't call explicitly for revolution</li>
                    <li>Vote against everything (unless tactically useful)</li>
                    <li>Obstruct, disrupt, create chaos</li>
                    <li>Walk out dramatically to show contempt</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>On the streets:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SA beats up communists, disrupts rallies</li>
                    <li>Hitler publicly "condemns" violence (wink wink)</li>
                    <li>"We were just defending ourselves from Marxist attack"</li>
                    <li>Goal: Intimidate opponents while maintaining deniability</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Strasser Problem</h3>
            
            <p>Your party contains incompatible visions:</p>
            
            <ul style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Strasser wing:</strong> Genuine socialism; nationalize industry; People's Army; appeal to workers</li>
                <li><strong>Hitler wing:</strong> Preserve capitalism; court elites; focus on race and nationalism</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Short-term:</strong> Keep both wings. You need workers (Strasser) and funding (Hitler).</p>
            <p><strong>Long-term:</strong> If you take power, Hitler will likely purge Strasser to consolidate elite support.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Decisions</h3>
            
            <ul style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>DNVP alliance:</strong> Continue using Hugenberg or break free?</li>
                <li><strong>Economic message:</strong> Anticapitalist (workers) or anti-communist (middle class)?</li>
                <li><strong>SA violence:</strong> Escalate or rein in? (Helps intimidate but alienates moderates)</li>
                <li><strong>Electoral strategy:</strong> Focus on Bavaria or expand nationally?</li>
                <li><strong>Reichstag tactics:</strong> Participate or walk out in protest?</li>
                <li><strong>If offered power:</strong> Join coalition or hold out for dictatorship?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Victory Objectives</h3>
            
            <p>Your specific victory objectives will be on your role sheet, but generally the NSDAP seeks:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Massive electoral growth (aim for 20%+ in next election)</li>
                <li>Gain legitimacy (DNVP alliance, Frick ministry in Thuringia)</li>
                <li>Expand SA (dominate streets)</li>
                <li>Destabilize Republic (lower Stability Index)</li>
                <li>Obstruct government (make democracy look chaotic)</li>
                <li>Ultimate goal: Seize total power and establish dictatorship</li>
            </ul>

                <p>In actual history, the NSDAP grew from 2.6% (1928) to 18.3% (1930) to 37.3% (July 1932) by exploiting the Depression.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Can you replicate this growth? Or will players recognize the threat and stop you before you become unstoppable?</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Everyone underestimated Hitler. Don't let them underestimate you.</p>
