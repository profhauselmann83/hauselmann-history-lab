        <!-- IDEOLOGY -->
        <section id="ideology">
            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            
            <p>The Centre Party belongs to the <strong>Christian democracy movement</strong> that emerged in the early nineteenth century. Our central concern has been the <strong>preservation of Catholic rights</strong>, a position that has made us open to many liberal ideas. At the same time, we closely ally with the conservative Catholic elite.</p>
            
            <p>Loyal to the pope in church matters, the Centre is <strong>independent of the Holy See on secular matters</strong>. Our conservative wing longs for a return to the moral and social harmony of the preindustrial world. Our labor wing, organized in the Christian trade unions, attempts to transcend its Catholic character and create a modern Christian middle party that accepts industrial modernity.</p>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>The Essential Coalition Partner</h4>
                <p>Generally guided by moderates, the Centre's <strong>pragmatic principles leave us open to supporting either a monarchical or republican form of government</strong>. We have been an essential member of nearly every cabinet and coalition and seem inured to the dramatic electoral vagaries of other parties.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Our stability:</strong> While other parties rise and fall, we consistently poll around 12-15%. German Catholics vote Centre. Our support is rock-solid.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>The Catholic Milieu</h4>
                <p>We are more than a political party. We represent an entire Catholic <em>milieu</em>—a complete social world:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Christian trade unions:</strong> Catholic workers organized separately from socialist unions</li>
                    <li><strong>Catholic press:</strong> Newspapers, magazines, publishing houses</li>
                    <li><strong>Catholic organizations:</strong> Youth groups, women's associations, sports clubs</li>
                    <li><strong>Catholic education:</strong> Schools, universities, adult education</li>
                    <li><strong>Parish networks:</strong> Local churches as centers of political organization</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> A Catholic can live their entire life within Centre Party institutions. This makes our base incredibly loyal.</p>

            <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Catholic Social Teaching</h4>
                <p>We follow papal encyclicals on social questions, especially <em>Rerum Novarum</em> (1891). Key principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Subsidiarity:</strong> Decisions should be made at the lowest competent level</li>
                    <li><strong>Solidarity:</strong> Rich and poor have mutual obligations</li>
                    <li><strong>Dignity of work:</strong> Workers deserve just wages and humane conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to property:</strong> But property has social duties</li>
                    <li><strong>Corporatism:</strong> Organize society by profession, not class conflict</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Protection of Catholic Rights</h4>
                <p>Our founding purpose: defend Catholics against Protestant Prussian domination. We fight for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Catholic schools:</strong> Right to educate our children in the faith</li>
                    <li><strong>Church autonomy:</strong> Vatican, not Berlin, governs spiritual matters</li>
                    <li><strong>Religious freedom:</strong> No discrimination based on religion</li>
                    <li><strong>Traditional family:</strong> Marriage, family, children central to society</li>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Pragmatic Moderation</h4>
                <p>We are neither rigidly conservative nor revolutionary. We seek:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Compromise:</strong> Build coalitions, find middle ground</li>
                    <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Avoid extremes of left and right</li>
                    <li><strong>Gradual reform:</strong> Improve society without upheaval</li>

                <h4>Christian Democratic Vision</h4>
                <p>We envision a <strong>Christian democratic state</strong> that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protects workers without embracing Marxism</li>
                    <li>Preserves property without embracing unchecked capitalism</li>
                    <li>Maintains order without embracing authoritarianism</li>

                <p>A nobleman, diplomat, and general staff officer, he is one of the few Catholics who seem <strong>close to the conservative Prussian Junker class</strong>; he surprised his party in 1925 by supporting von Hindenburg over its own candidate.</p>

            <h3>The Balancing Act</h3>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>⚠️ The Centre's Dilemma</h4>
                <p>We are the <strong>pivot party</strong>. We can form coalitions left (with SPD) or right (with DNVP). This gives us power but also responsibility.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Coalition options:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Grand Coalition (current):</strong> SPD + Centre + DDP + DVP + BVP = stable but strained</li>
                    <li><strong>Weimar Coalition:</strong> SPD + Centre + DDP = pro-Republic but no majority without DVP</li>
                    <li><strong>Bourgeois Coalition:</strong> Centre + DDP + DVP + BVP = excludes SPD, moderate right</li>
                    <li><strong>Hindenburg Front:</strong> Centre + DVP + DNVP + BVP = conservative, monarchist-friendly</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Our wings pull in opposite directions. Stegerwald wants to work with SPD. Von Papen wants to work with DNVP. Brüning tries to hold us together.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stable support:</strong> 12-15% every election; Catholics vote Centre</li>
                        <li><strong>Essential for coalitions:</strong> Neither left nor right can govern without us</li>
                        <li><strong>Social infrastructure:</strong> Catholic milieu provides organization beyond politics</li>
                        <li><strong>Experienced leaders:</strong> In government continuously since 1919</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-class appeal:</strong> Workers, farmers, middle class, aristocrats all Catholic</li>
                        <li><strong>Vatican backing:</strong> Moral authority of Church supports us</li>
                        <li><strong>Christian trade unions:</strong> Alternative to Marxist unions</li>
                        <li><strong>Moderate reputation:</strong> Seen as reasonable, pragmatic, trustworthy</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Limited to Catholics:</strong> Cannot grow beyond ~15% (Protestant majority)</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal divisions:</strong> Conservative vs. labor wings often clash</li>
                        <li><strong>Pulled both directions:</strong> SPD and DNVP both want our support</li>
                        <li><strong>Compromised position:</strong> In every coalition, so blamed for everything</li>
                        <li><strong>NSDAP competition:</strong> Nazis appeal to Catholic conservatives, small farmers</li>
                        <li><strong>Unclear principles:</strong> Too pragmatic? Do we stand for anything beyond Catholic interests?</li>
                        <li><strong>Vatican interference:</strong> Sometimes Pope's priorities conflict with German political needs</li>

        <!-- ROLE IN GAME -->
        <section id="game-role">
            <h2>Playing the Centre Party</h2>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Your Position in the Game</h4>
                <p>You are the <strong>pivot party</strong>. With 61 seats, you're not large enough to dominate, but you're essential for any coalition. <strong>No government can form without you or against you.</strong></p>
                
                <p>This gives you enormous power—but also enormous responsibility. You decide whether Germany moves left or right.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Strategic Considerations</h3>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>The Coalition Question</h4>
                <p><strong>You will face constant pressure from all sides:</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>SPD says:</strong> "Stay in the Grand Coalition. Support workers. Defend the Republic."</p>
                <p><strong>DNVP says:</strong> "Join us in a conservative coalition. The SPD are Marxists. Protect traditional values."</p>
                <p><strong>Your conservative wing says:</strong> "The SPD are godless socialists. Work with DNVP."</p>
                <p><strong>Your labor wing says:</strong> "We're workers too. Support the Grand Coalition."</p>
                <p><strong>The Vatican says:</strong> "Protect the Church above all."</p>
                
                <p><strong>What do YOU decide?</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Key Decisions</h3>
            
            <ul style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Austerity crisis:</strong> Support SPD (protect workers) or DVP (fiscal responsibility)?</li>
                <li><strong>Young Plan:</strong> Support pragmatic foreign policy or join DNVP opposition?</li>
                <li><strong>Naval Bills:</strong> Fund military or oppose waste during economic crisis?</li>
                <li><strong>Grain Tariffs:</strong> Protect Catholic farmers or reduce food costs for workers?</li>
                <li><strong>Coalition collapse:</strong> If Grand Coalition falls, form new coalition with whom?</li>
                <li><strong>NSDAP threat:</strong> Work with SPD to stop fascism or hope for conservative alternative?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Managing Internal Divisions</h3>
            
            <p>Your party contains incompatible factions. <strong>Party discipline</strong> is difficult to maintain when wings pull opposite directions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Options:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to hold party together through compromise (Brüning's approach)</li>
                <li>Let wings split their votes (admit divisions exist)</li>
                <li>Side decisively with one wing (risk party split)</li>
                <li>Focus on protecting Catholic interests (unity through shared identity)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Victory Objectives</h3>
            
            <p>Your specific victory objectives will be on your role sheet, but generally the Centre seeks:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain stable government (prevent chaos)</li>
                <li>Protect Catholic schools and Church autonomy</li>
                <li>Balance budget (fiscal responsibility)</li>
                <li>Support workers through Christian unions (not Marxism)</li>
                <li>Block extremists (both KPD and NSDAP)</li>
                <li>Build Christian democratic consensus</li>
                <li>Keep party united (don't lose either wing)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Remember</h4>
                <p>You are <strong>kingmakers</strong>. Governments rise and fall based on your decisions. Use this power wisely. The future of the Republic may depend on whether you choose to support democracy or turn toward authoritarianism.</p>
