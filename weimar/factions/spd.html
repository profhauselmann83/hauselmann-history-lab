        <section id="ideology">
            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            
            <p>The SPD has existed since 1875 and remains <strong>loyal to its Marxist roots</strong>. The Heidelberg Program of 1925 calls for the "transformation of the capitalist system of private ownership of the means of production to social ownership."</p>
            
            <p>However, in practice, we have moved away from revolution and have become <strong>firmly supportive of the Republic</strong>. We now plan to achieve our goals through democratic reform.</p>
            
            <p>As the main nonrevolutionary left-wing party, the SPD fares best among non-Catholic workers as well as intellectuals favoring progressive social causes and increased economic equality.</p>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Our Achievements</h4>
                <p>As the largest party, the SPD plays a pivotal role in keeping the state afloat. We put our ideas of social justice into practice every chance we get:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Overhauled the welfare state</strong> - unemployment insurance, pensions, health care</li>
                    <li><strong>Expanded education</strong> - job training, adult education, public libraries</li>
                    <li><strong>Built infrastructure</strong> - schools, swimming pools, health clinics, low-income housing</li>
                    <li><strong>Protected workers</strong> - 8-hour workday, collective bargaining rights, workplace safety</li>
                    <li><strong>Defended democracy</strong> - faced down right-wing violence, protected constitutional rights</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>The SPD has every reason to support the Republic based on these tangible gains.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>The 1928 Victory</h4>
                <p>The 1928 elections resulted in the SPD again securing the chancellorship. Now in power, even under the trying conditions of the Great Depression, the SPD can hope for continued growth.</p>
                
                <p><strong>An absolute majority in the next election is not unthinkable</strong> and would mean that the party could cease its constant compromising with right-wing parties.</p>

            <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Democratic Socialism</h4>
                <p>We are Marxists who believe in democratic methods. Revolution failed in 1918-1919 and led to disaster. The path forward is through elections, legislation, and gradual transformation of capitalism into socialism.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Workers' Rights</h4>
                <p>The working class built Germany. Workers deserve dignity, fair wages, safe conditions, and a voice in economic decisions. Unemployment insurance is a <em>right</em>, not a privilege. We will not abandon workers to market forces.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Defense of the Republic</h4>
                <p>The Weimar Republic is <em>our</em> Republic. We proclaimed it in 1918. We wrote its constitution. We defend it against monarchists, fascists, and communists. Democracy is the only path to socialism.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Internationalism</h4>
                <p>We support cooperation with the international community. Erfüllungspolitik (gradual revision of Versailles through compliance) is pragmatic. War benefits only capitalists. Workers of all nations are our allies.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Secularism and Progress</h4>
                <p>We support separation of church and state, women's equality, educational opportunity for all, and scientific progress. The future belongs to reason, not religious dogma or aristocratic tradition.</p>

                <h3>Hermann Müller</h3>
                <p class="role">Chancellor of Germany (Current Grand Coalition)</p>
                
                <p>The foreign minister who signed the Treaty of Versailles, he is now serving a second term as chancellor. He is a <strong>pragmatic moderate</strong> in the party, noted for his negotiating skills.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Holding together the Grand Coalition while managing the economic crisis. The DVP wants austerity; the SPD base demands protection of workers. Can he find a compromise?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Paul Löbe</h3>
                <p class="role">Speaker of the Reichstag</p>
                
                <p>The Speaker of the Reichstag, he has a reputation for fairness but also for being on the <strong>left in his party</strong> and an active supporter of the pro-Republic paramilitary, the Reichsbanner.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Power:</strong> Controls the agenda, decides who speaks, can table votes. The Speaker shapes what the Reichstag debates.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Carl Severing</h3>
                <p class="role">Interior Minister</p>
                
                <p>The interior minister, he has dedicated his career since the revolution to <strong>institutionalizing democracy at all levels</strong>, especially in the police. Due to his willingness to compromise with anyone, he is regarded as part of the <strong>right wing of the party</strong>.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Controversial decision:</strong> Ordered police to fire on KPD demonstrators on May Day 1929, killing 30+. Then banned the Red Front paramilitary. The KPD calls him a traitor to the working class.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Philipp Scheidemann</h3>
                <p class="role">Former Chancellor; proclaimed the Republic</p>
                
                <p>Every person in Germany knows his name. He was the man who <strong>proclaimed the Republic</strong> on November 9, 1918, and served as its first chancellor—resigning from office rather than sign the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Symbol:</strong> Embodies the SPD's creation of the Republic and its principled opposition to Versailles.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Paul Levi</h3>
                <p class="role">Left Wing; former KPD leader</p>
                
                <p>A former leader of the KPD, he has since become alienated from the communists, often looking for ideas from Leon Trotsky, a position that places him on the <strong>left of the SPD</strong>. His Jewish roots and sympathy for the KPD make him a frequent target of right-wing attacks.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Maria Jachucz</h3>
                <p class="role">Women's Advocate; Labor Rights Champion</p>
                
                <p>The first woman to ever speak in a German parliament (at the National Assembly in 1919), she is one of the great orators of the socialist movement, well known for her <strong>staunch advocacy of workers' welfare</strong>.</p>

            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Carlo Mierendorff</h3>
                <p class="role">Anti-Fascist Activist</p>
                
                <p>He is one of the most outspoken anti-NSDAP politicians in the nation, directly challenging its leaders and its right to exist. He has also led the SPD's criticisms of the Reichswehr.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Arthur Crispien</h3>
                <p class="role">Left Wing; Workers' Advocate</p>
                
                <p>When the SPD split in 1918, he initially joined the left-leaning faction before deciding to move away from the KPD. He <strong>staunchly advocates for the rights of workers</strong>, thus associating himself with the left wing.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Kurt Schumacher</h3>
                <p class="role">Youngest Member; Reformist</p>
                
                <p>The youngest member of the SPD in government, he nonetheless endorses more reformist ideas, <strong>rejecting all notions of violent revolution</strong> and instead embracing a fully democratic vision of regulating capitalism.</p>

                    <p><strong>Position:</strong> More militant defense of workers; skeptical of coalitions with bourgeois parties; sympathetic to KPD on some issues</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>On austerity:</strong> NEVER cut unemployment benefits under any circumstances</p>
                    <p><strong>On KPD:</strong> Potential allies against the Right; ban on Red Front was a mistake</p>
                    <p><strong>On coalitions:</strong> Prefer SPD-only government or coalition with Centre; DVP too conservative</p>

                    <p><strong>On austerity:</strong> Open to small cuts if necessary to save coalition</p>
                    <p><strong>On KPD:</strong> Dangerous revolutionaries; Red Front ban was necessary</p>
                    <p><strong>On coalitions:</strong> Grand Coalition essential; must work with DVP</p>

                    <p><strong>On austerity:</strong> Seek compromise - some cuts, some tax increases</p>
                    <p><strong>On KPD:</strong> Rivals, not allies; but don't want permanent split in working class</p>
                    <p><strong>On coalitions:</strong> Grand Coalition best option but has limits</p>

                <h4>⚠️ The SPD's Greatest Challenge</h4>
                <p>We are the largest party, but we don't have a majority. We need coalition partners. This means <strong>compromise</strong>.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Grand Coalition includes:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SPD (153):</strong> Workers, socialists</li>
                    <li><strong>DDP (25):</strong> Liberal democrats (reliable allies)</li>
                    <li><strong>Centre (61):</strong> Catholic moderates (mostly reliable)</li>
                    <li><strong>BVP (16):</strong> Bavarian conservatives (unpredictable)</li>
                    <li><strong>DVP (45):</strong> Business liberals (often opposed to us)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Total: 300 / 491 seats (61% majority)</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>The problem:</strong> DVP wants austerity. We can't abandon workers. If we cut benefits, our base revolts. If we refuse cuts, DVP may collapse the coalition.</p>
                
                <p><strong>If the coalition collapses:</strong> Presidential government, rule by decree, or elections during economic crisis (which could strengthen extremists).</p>

            <h2>Playing the SPD</h2>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Your Position in the Game</h4>
                <p>You are the <strong>governing party</strong>. Chancellor Müller (SPD) leads the Grand Coalition. Speaker Löbe (SPD) controls the agenda. Interior Minister Severing (SPD) enforces law and order.</p>
                
                <p><strong>This means you have power - but also responsibility. If democracy fails, it's partly on you.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Strategic Considerations</h3>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>The Austerity Crisis</h4>
                <p><strong>This is THE issue that threatens everything.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Unemployment is soaring. The insurance fund is bankrupt. The DVP demands cuts to balance the budget. Your base demands you protect workers.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Your options:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Cut benefits:</strong> Save coalition, betray workers, lose voters to KPD</li>
                    <li><strong>Refuse cuts:</strong> DVP leaves coalition, government collapses, presidential rule?</li>
                    <li><strong>Compromise:</strong> Small cuts + tax increases = neither side happy but coalition survives</li>
                    <li><strong>Pass the issue to Hindenburg:</strong> Ask for emergency decree = strengthen presidential government</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>There is no good option. Choose wisely.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Other Major Decisions</h3>
            
            <ul style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Young Plan:</strong> Support it (pragmatic foreign policy) or oppose it (DVP/Centre may leave)?</li>
                <li><strong>Naval Bills:</strong> Fund armored cruisers (keep DVP happy, anger workers) or vote no (collapse coalition)?</li>
                <li><strong>KPD:</strong> Maintain ban on Red Front (alienate communists) or lift it (unite working class)?</li>
                <li><strong>NSDAP:</strong> Ban SA (provoke crisis) or tolerate them (let fascism grow)?</li>
                <li><strong>Elections:</strong> Call early elections (risky during crisis) or delay (let coalition fracture)?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Victory Objectives</h3>
            
            <p>Your specific victory objectives will be on your role sheet, but generally the SPD seeks:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain the Grand Coalition (preserve parliamentary government)</li>
                <li>Pass the Young Plan (fulfill Erfüllungspolitik)</li>
                <li>Protect unemployment benefits (defend workers)</li>
                <li>Block NSDAP/DNVP (prevent fascist/monarchist takeover)</li>
                <li>Win next election (aim for absolute majority)</li>
                <li>Keep Stability Index high (prevent crisis)</li>
            </ul>
