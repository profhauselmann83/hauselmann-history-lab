        <!-- IDEOLOGY -->
        <section id="ideology">
            <h2>Who They Are</h2>
            
            <p>The circle of men immediately around <strong>President Paul von Hindenburg</strong> (the so-called Camarilla) is highly influential. These fellow Junkers share the president's basic experiences and worldviews—military service, authoritarian social order, Protestant conservativism.</p>
            
            <p>They served in the war and are <strong>unrepentant monarchists</strong>. Above all, they promote the interests of an autonomous military, free of civilian control. Naturally, in accord with the president's public statements, they hold Germany faultless for the war and seek an end to Versailles.</p>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>⚠️ A State Within the State</h4>
                <p>Some observers suggest that the Camarilla subverts the rule of law. Others suspect that they manipulate the aged von Hindenburg, who seems to many to be drifting into senility.</p>
                
                <p><strong>If true, then the presidency may be in the hands of forces hostile to the Republic.</strong></p>
                
                <p>However, their workings are so secretive that only a handful of leading politicians have any meaningful insight into their goals.</p>

        <!-- CORE BELIEFS -->
        <section id="beliefs">
            <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Authoritarian Order</h4>
                <p>Democracy is weak and chaotic. Germany needs strong leadership from military and aristocratic elites. The Kaiserreich's hierarchical social order was superior to parliamentary squabbling.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Military Autonomy</h4>
                <p>The Reichswehr must remain independent of civilian control. Military decisions should be made by military professionals, not politicians. The army is the guardian of German honor.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Monarchist Restoration</h4>
                <p>The Republic is illegitimate. Germany needs a monarch (though not necessarily the exiled Kaiser). A constitutional monarchy with a strong executive is preferable to parliamentary democracy.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Junker Privilege</h4>
                <p>The Junker class (Prussian landowning aristocracy) has a natural right to rule. Their estates must be protected through subsidies (Osthilfe) and grain tariffs. Land reform is Bolshevism.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Anti-Versailles</h4>
                <p>Germany bears no guilt for the war. Versailles is a criminal diktat. All reparations payments are illegitimate. German territory must be restored, especially the Polish Corridor.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>President Paul von Hindenburg</h3>
                <p class="role">Reich President (elected 1925)</p>
                
                <p>He personifies the conservative nationalist interests of the Junkers. He is <strong>the single most popular man in Germany</strong>. A hero of the war for most, even for some of his opponents, few doubt his integrity. He stands as a bastion of the old regime at the top of the new.</p>
                
                <p><strong>His goals are correspondingly unclear to many.</strong> He is rumored to desire a restoration of the monarchy, or perhaps a military dictatorship.</p>
                
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>Background</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Born 1847 into Junker military family</li>
                        <li>Fought in Austro-Prussian War (1866) and Franco-Prussian War (1870-71)</li>
                        <li>Retired 1911, recalled 1914 at age 67</li>
                        <li>Supreme Commander of German forces 1916-1918 (with Ludendorff)</li>
                        <li>Became national hero after victory at Tannenberg (1914)</li>
                        <li>Elected President 1925 (age 77) as candidate of the Right</li>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>Political Position</h4>
                    <p><strong>Publicly:</strong> Swore oath to uphold the constitution; claims to be neutral arbiter</p>
                    <p><strong>Privately:</strong> Monarchist who sees Republic as temporary; surrounds himself with anti-democratic advisers</p>
                    <p><strong>Power:</strong> Immense popularity gives him authority beyond constitutional powers; can dissolve Reichstag, rule by decree, appoint chancellors</p>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>The Question Everyone Asks:</strong> Is Hindenburg a loyal republican or a closet monarchist waiting to restore authoritarianism?</p>

                <p class="role">Defense Minister and Political Fixer</p>
                
                <p>As head of the Office of Ministerial Affairs, he officially deals with all matters relating to joint concerns of the army and navy. He is tasked with liaising between the military, other departments, and politicians—<strong>a sort of political fixer</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>He has interpreted his mandate broadly, allowing the Reichswehr to engage directly in politics, but <strong>no one knows where von Schleicher stands</strong>, apart from his unwavering support for the Reichswehr.</p>

                    <h4>Political Strategy</h4>
                    <p><strong>The "Schleicher Method":</strong> Backroom deals, coalition manipulation, playing parties against each other</p>
                    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Keep Reichswehr autonomous and well-funded; prevent either far-left or far-right from gaining total control</p>
                    <p><strong>Tactics:</strong> Willing to work with anyone—SPD, DNVP, even NSDAP—if it serves military interests</p>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Reputation:</strong> "The General in the Shadows" - brilliant political operator or cynical manipulator?</p>

                <h3>Otto Meissner</h3>
                <p class="role">State Secretary to the Office of the Reich President</p>
                
                <p>He has served as head of the Office of the Reich President since 1920, serving with <strong>equal loyalty and skill</strong> under presidents Ebert (SPD) and von Hindenburg.</p>
                
                <p>His opinions and goals are unknown, and he has never joined any political organization. He appears to embody the spirit of German bureaucracy—<strong>diligent, formal, and obscure</strong>.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Does he have influence over the president, or is he just a civil servant?</strong></p>
                
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>The Riddle of Meissner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Possibility 1:</strong> A neutral technocrat who loyally serves whoever holds the presidency</p>
                    <p><strong>Possibility 2:</strong> A hidden power broker who controls access to Hindenburg and shapes presidential decisions</p>
                    <p><strong>Possibility 3:</strong> A monarchist operative working to subvert the Republic from within</p>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>What we know:</strong> He controls Hindenburg's schedule, decides who gets access to the President, drafts many of Hindenburg's official statements. <strong>That's enormous power for a "mere bureaucrat."</strong></p>

                <h4>Short-Term Goals</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Protect Reichswehr autonomy:</strong> Keep military free from Reichstag control</li>
                    <li><strong>Fund the armed forces:</strong> Pass naval bills, increase military budget</li>
                    <li><strong>Protect Junker estates:</strong> Maintain grain tariffs and Osthilfe subsidies</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevent "Bolshevism":</strong> Block SPD/KPD attempts at land reform or nationalization</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintain order:</strong> Suppress communist uprisings</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Long-Term Goals</h4>

                    <li><strong>Revise or destroy Versailles</strong></li>

            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>The Camarilla's Toolkit</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Presidential Powers:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Article 48: Rule by emergency decree</li>
                    <li>Article 25: Dissolve the Reichstag</li>
                    <li>Article 53: Appoint chancellors regardless of Reichstag support</li>
                    <li>Grant pardons and amnesties</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Behind-the-Scenes Influence:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Control access to Hindenburg</li>
                    <li>Advise President on appointments and decrees</li>
                    <li>Coordinate with DNVP and conservative parties</li>
                    <li>Maintain links to industrialists and Junkers</li>
                    <li>Use Reichswehr as implicit threat</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>The 25/48/53 Formula:</strong></p>
                <p>The Camarilla could bypass the Reichstag entirely: Appoint a chancellor without parliamentary support (Article 53), rule by emergency decree (Article 48), and dissolve the Reichstag if it objects (Article 25). <strong>This would end parliamentary democracy while remaining technically constitutional.</strong></p>

                        <li><strong>Hindenburg's popularity:</strong> Most popular man in Germany; immense legitimacy</li>
                        <li><strong>Constitutional powers:</strong> President has enormous legal authority</li>
                        <li><strong>Military backing:</strong> Reichswehr loyal to Hindenburg personally</li>
                        <li><strong>Elite networks:</strong> Connected to Junkers, industrialists, old aristocracy</li>
                        <li><strong>Secrecy:</strong> Operate behind closed doors; opponents can't expose them</li>
                        <li><strong>Patience:</strong> Can wait for crisis to justify authoritarian measures</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hindenburg's age:</strong> 82 years old in 1929; health declining; senility rumors</li>
                        <li><strong>No party base:</strong> Cannot win elections or mobilize masses</li>
                        <li><strong>Dependent on coalitions:</strong> Need parliamentary cooperation to govern normally</li>
                        <li><strong>Unpopular policies:</strong> Junker subsidies, military spending anger voters</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited scope:</strong> Can rule by decree, but that creates crisis; unsustainable long-term</li>
                        <li><strong>Divided Right:</strong> DNVP, NSDAP, conservatives compete; Camarilla must choose sides</li>
                    </ul>

        <!-- ROLE IN GAME -->
        <section id="game-role">
            <h2>Playing the Camarilla</h2>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Your Position in the Game</h4>
                <p>The Camarilla sits apart from the parties. You observe debates but do not vote in the Reichstag. However, <strong>you wield presidential powers</strong> that can override the entire parliament.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Your Powers</h3>
            
            <ul style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Issue emergency decrees</strong> (Article 48) - requires Chancellor's countersignature</li>
                <li><strong>Dissolve the Reichstag</strong> (Article 25) - call new elections</li>
                <li><strong>Appoint the Chancellor</strong> (Article 53) - does not require Reichstag majority</li>
                <li><strong>Grant pardons and amnesties</strong> (Article 49)</li>
                <li><strong>Command the Reichswehr</strong> - military answers to President, not Reichstag</li>
                <li><strong>Call for presidential elections</strong> - or refuse to run for re-election</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Strategic Considerations</h3>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>The Camarilla's Dilemma</h4>
                <p>You have enormous power, but using it creates crisis. Every emergency decree, every dissolution, every minority government weakens parliamentary democracy and creates backlash.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Do you:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Work within the system, supporting moderate coalitions?</li>
                    <li>Gradually undermine parliament through selective intervention?</li>
                    <li>Wait for crisis, then seize full control?</li>
                    <li>Ally with DNVP to restore monarchy?</li>
                    <li>Use NSDAP as battering ram against left, then discard them?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Victory Objectives</h3>
            
            <p>Your specific victory objectives will be on your role sheet, but generally the Camarilla seeks:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Protect military autonomy and funding</li>
                <li>Preserve Junker estates and privileges</li>
                <li>Prevent land reform or nationalization</li>
                <li>Weaken or eliminate Marxist parties</li>
                <li>Establish authoritarian government (monarchy or military dictatorship)</li>
                <li>Revise or destroy Versailles</li>
            </ul>
