                    <li><strong>Founded:</strong> 1918 (created to oppose Republic)</li>
                    <li><strong>Reichstag Seats:</strong> 76 / 491 (15.5%)</li>
                    <li><strong>Support Base:</strong> Junkers, Protestants, nationalists, conservatives, business elites</li>
                    <li><strong>Stance on Republic:</strong> Fundamentally opposed - seek restoration of monarchy</li>
                    <li><strong>Current Leader:</strong> Alfred Hugenberg (since 1928)</li>
                    <li><strong>Paramilitary:</strong> Stahlhelm (Steel Helmet) - ~500,000 members</li>

        <!-- IDEOLOGY -->
        <section id="ideology">
            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            
            <p>The DNVP is by far the <strong>most powerful party of the Right</strong>. We are correspondingly eclectic, composed of nationalists, reactionary monarchists, völkisch and antisemitic elements, and pan-Germanists.</p>
            
            <p>The DNVP spent the Republic's early days in opposition. Between 1925 and 1928, however, the party slightly moderated its tone and actively cooperated in several right-center cabinets. But <strong>in the 1928 elections, the party suffered a disastrous showing, falling to just 14 percent</strong>.</p>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>The Hugenberg Takeover (1928)</h4>
                <p>As a result of the electoral disaster, <strong>Alfred Hugenberg</strong>, from the party's right wing, became chair, and favors <strong>fundamental opposition to the Republic</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>The result has been a series of internal power struggles and splits. But the party is adapting:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replaced the former kaiser with von Hindenburg as object of veneration</li>
                    <li>Openly cooperates with the NSDAP</li>
                    <li>Integrated fascist elements into our thinking</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The party has taken a drubbing but is far from out. <strong>We have vast financial resources, a press empire, and links to von Schleicher and von Hindenburg.</strong> And the campaign against the Young Plan has energized the conservative base.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Our Resources</h4>
                <p>The DNVP is the wealthiest party in Germany:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hugenberg's media empire:</strong> Newspapers, film studios, wire services across Germany</li>
                    <li><strong>Industrial backing:</strong> Heavy industry, mining, steel magnates fund us</li>
                    <li><strong>Junker estates:</strong> Large landowners are our core</li>
                    <li><strong>Stahlhelm:</strong> Largest paramilitary after Reichsbanner</li>
                    <li><strong>Links to Camarilla:</strong> Hindenburg, von Schleicher, Meissner sympathetic</li>
                    <li><strong>Protestant Church networks:</strong> Conservative clergy support us</li>

        <!-- CORE BELIEFS -->
        <section id="beliefs">
            <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Restoration of Monarchy</h4>
                <p>The Republic is illegitimate—born of military defeat and the "stab in the back." Germany needs a <strong>strong monarch</strong> to restore order, honor, and traditional hierarchy. We don't necessarily want the exiled Kaiser Wilhelm II back, but we want monarchy.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Rejection of Versailles (Katastrophenpolitik)</h4>
                <p>Germany bears <strong>no guilt</strong> for the war. Versailles is a criminal diktat imposed by vengeful enemies. We reject:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>All reparations</strong> - not one mark to our enemies</li>
                    <li><strong>Territorial losses</strong> - especially the Polish Corridor</li>
                    <li><strong>Military restrictions</strong> - Germany has a right to defend itself</li>
                    <li><strong>War guilt clause</strong> - a lie and an insult</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Katastrophenpolitik (policy of catastrophe) - confrontational defiance will force treaty revision. Compliance only legitimizes enslavement.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Pan-Germanism and Lebensraum</h4>
                <p>All ethnic Germans belong in one Greater Germany. We support:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Recovery of lost territories:</strong> Polish Corridor, Alsace-Lorraine, colonies</li>
                    <li><strong>Union with Austria:</strong> All Germans in one Reich</li>
                    <li><strong>Lebensraum:</strong> Germany needs "living space" in the East</li>
                    <li><strong>Germanization:</strong> Assimilate or remove Slavic peoples from German lands</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Antisemitism and Völkisch Nationalism</h4>
                <p>Germany is for Germans. We embrace <strong>cultural anti-Judaism</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Jewish values</strong> oppose German ideals and traditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Jews control</strong> international finance, Marxism, the press</li>
                    <li><strong>November criminals</strong> (who created the Republic) are largely Jewish</li>
                    <li><strong>Jews can assimilate</strong> if they abandon Jewishness and embrace German culture</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><em>Note: We differ from NSDAP's racial antisemitism. We oppose Jewish influence but allow assimilation. NSDAP sees Jews as biologically unchangeable.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Authoritarian Order</h4>
                <p>Parliamentary democracy is weak and chaotic. Germany needs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strong executive:</strong> President or monarch with real power</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited parliament:</strong> Advisory role, not sovereign</li>
                    <li><strong>Social hierarchy:</strong> Natural aristocracy should lead</li>
                    <li><strong>Discipline and order:</strong> End the chaos of competing parties</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Protection of Junker Privileges</h4>
                <p>The Prussian aristocracy (Junkers) are Germany's natural leaders. We fight for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Grain tariffs:</strong> Protect estates from foreign competition</li>
                    <li><strong>Osthilfe subsidies:</strong> State support for agriculture</li>
                    <li><strong>No land reform:</strong> Confiscation is Bolshevism</li>
                    <li><strong>Military autonomy:</strong> Reichswehr led by aristocratic officers</li>

                <h4>⚠️ Playing with Fire</h4>
                <p>Hugenberg has allied the DNVP with the NSDAP to campaign against the Young Plan. This is controversial within the party.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Hugenberg's reasoning:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NSDAP brings energy and mass appeal</li>
                    <li>Both oppose Republic and Versailles</li>
                    <li>Together we can destroy the parliamentary system</li>
                    <li>We're the respectable face; they're the street fighters</li>
                    <li>Once Republic falls, we'll control the new government (NSDAP are too vulgar to lead)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Critics (Westarp faction) warn:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NSDAP are radical demagogues</li>
                    <li>Hitler won't be controlled</li>
                    <li>Alliance legitimizes fascist extremism</li>
                    <li>NSDAP will steal our voters</li>
                    <li>We're making them respectable</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Your Position in the Game</h4>
                <p>You are the <strong>main conservative opposition party</strong>. With 76 seats, you're significant but not decisive. Your power comes from:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Financial resources:</strong> Hugenberg's media empire</li>
                    <li><strong>Links to Hindenburg:</strong> Can influence presidential decisions</li>

            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>The Hugenberg-Westarp Split</h4>
                <p><strong>You must decide: Which faction do you support?</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Hugenberg's radical course:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Freedom Law to destroy Erfüllungspolitik</li>
                    <li>Campaign against Young Plan with NSDAP</li>
                    <li>Fundamental opposition - bring down Republic</li>
                    <li>Risk: Alienates moderates, empowers NSDAP</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Westarp's moderate course:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Join right-center coalitions when possible</li>
                    <li>Work within system to influence policy</li>
                    <li>Distance from NSDAP extremism</li>
                    <li>Risk: Seen as weak, unprincipled; lose voters to NSDAP</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Key Decisions</h3>
            
            <ul style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Freedom Law:</strong> Hugenberg's flagship - do you support criminalizing cooperation with Versailles?</li>
                <li><strong>Young Plan:</strong> Campaign with NSDAP or accept pragmatic necessity?</li>
                <li><strong>Coalition options:</strong> Join right-center government or stay in opposition?</li>
                <li><strong>NSDAP alliance:</strong> Continue or break? Can you control them?</li>
                <li><strong>Presidential strategy:</strong> Use Hindenburg to bypass Reichstag?</li>
                <li><strong>Party unity:</strong> Purge moderates or compromise with Westarp faction?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Victory Objectives</h3>
            
            <p>Your specific victory objectives will be on your role sheet, but generally the DNVP seeks:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Pass the Freedom Law (Hugenberg's priority)</li>
                <li>Defeat the Young Plan (reject reparations)</li>
                <li>Bring down SPD-led government</li>
                <li>Win back lost voters (aim for 20%+ in next election)</li>
                <li>Protect Junker interests (tariffs, subsidies, no land reform)</li>
                <li>Install authoritarian government (presidential or monarchist)</li>
                <li>Lower Stability Index (create crisis)</li>
                <li>Eliminate Marxist parties (ban SPD/KPD)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Remember</h4>
                <p>You are <strong>playing with fire</strong> by allying with the NSDAP. They may be useful tools now, but can you control them later? Or will Hitler use your respectability to legitimize his movement, then discard you once he no longer needs you?</p>
                
                <p><strong>History suggests the latter. Choose wisely.</strong></p>
