            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            
            <p>The KPD has become the <strong>largest communist party outside of the USSR</strong>, yet it only formed officially in 1919, after splitting from the SPD over questions related to the war (the KPD opposed war) and the Russian Revolution (the KPD supports the Bolsheviks).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Committed to social revolution</strong>, the KPD launched several attempts to seize power in the Republic's early years but has since adopted a policy of building its support legally. Though often wracked by internal conflict, it has become a mass party—<strong>implacably hostile to fascism, liberalism, and social democracy</strong>.</p>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>Our Martyrs</h4>
                <p>On January 15, 1919, <strong>Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht</strong>—founders of the KPD—were murdered by right-wing Freikorps acting with SPD government approval.</p>
                
                <p><strong>We will never forget. We will never forgive.</strong></p>
                
                <p>The SPD chose to ally with reactionary militarists rather than build socialism. Their hands are stained with workers' blood. They are <strong>social fascists</strong>—more dangerous than the NSDAP because they deceive workers into supporting capitalism.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Our Relationship with Moscow</h4>
                <p>We look to the Soviet Union, now firmly in the hands of Stalin, and the <strong>Comintern</strong> (Communist International). Moscow provides:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ideological guidance:</strong> Stalin's Third Period theory guides our strategy</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial support:</strong> Funding for party operations and propaganda</li>
                    <li><strong>International solidarity:</strong> We are part of the global communist movement</li>
                    <li><strong>The model:</strong> The Bolshevik Revolution shows the way forward</li>

            <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Revolutionary Marxism</h4>
                <p>Capitalism cannot be reformed—it must be <strong>destroyed and replaced</strong>. Parliamentary democracy is a bourgeois sham. The only path to socialism is <strong>proletarian revolution</strong> and the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Social Fascism Theory</h4>
                <p>At the moment, we follow Stalin's directive: denounce <strong>"social fascism"</strong>. The SPD is a greater threat than the NSDAP because it dupes workers into supporting capitalism and thus provides the basis for fascism.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The SPD are not our allies. They are the enemy.</strong> Their "democratic socialism" is a lie that delays revolution.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Anti-Fascism</h4>
                <p>We are the only true anti-fascist force in Germany. The NSDAP represents the violent wing of capitalism. When capitalist democracy fails (as it must), the bourgeoisie will turn to fascism. <strong>Only communist revolution can stop them.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Proletarian Internationalism</h4>
                <p>Workers have no country. German workers have more in common with Soviet workers than with German capitalists. We reject nationalism and support the international communist movement led by the USSR.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Destabilize the Republic</h4>
                <p>The Weimar Republic is a capitalist state that must be destroyed. Every crisis brings us closer to revolution. <strong>We do not want to save this system—we want to replace it.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Key Figures in the Reichstag</h2>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Ernst Thälmann</h3>
                <p class="role">Party Leader</p>
                
                <p>Party leader, <strong>staunch Moscow loyalist</strong>, and advocate of a Stalinist interpretation of the party, he brooks no compromise with capitalism, the Republic, or the "social fascist" SPD.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Position:</strong> Hardline Stalinist. Completely loyal to Moscow. Believes in social fascism theory. Will not cooperate with SPD under any circumstances.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Clara Zetkin</h3>
                <p class="role">Eldest Member of the Reichstag</p>
                
                <p><strong>Eldest member of the Reichstag</strong> and personal friend of the martyred Rosa Luxemburg, she is firmly committed to the revolutionary path to socialism as carried out by the Bolsheviks.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Delivers the "First Address" after any Reichstag election as the eldest member. Symbol of revolutionary continuity.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Willi Münzenberg</h3>
                <p class="role">"The Red Millionaire" - Propaganda Chief</p>
                
                <p>One of the few members of the Reichstag from the working class, he has emerged as the party's greatest publicist, creating a <strong>communist press empire that rivals that of Hugenberg</strong>—a fact that has led many to criticize him as the "red millionaire."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Power:</strong> Controls newspapers, magazines, film companies. Masters communist propaganda and mass mobilization.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Walter Ulbricht</h3>
                <p class="role">Rising Star; Street Fighter</p>
                
                <p>A founding member of the KPD, he is now a <strong>rising star in the party</strong>, closely associated with the street fighting of the Red Front.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Position:</strong> Militant. Believes in direct action. Angry about Red Front ban.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Franz Dahlem</h3>
                <p class="role">Thälmann Loyalist; Anti-Fascist</p>
                
                <p>A <strong>staunch Thälmann supporter</strong>, leader of the Ruhr Rebellion in 1923, and now an advocate of the antifascist approach, he denounces the SPD as social fascists.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Arthur Ewert</h3>
                <p class="role">Comintern Agent; Factional Rival</p>
                
                <p>Directly involved with the KPD uprising in 1923, for many years he was a wanted man in Germany, but now he has <strong>close links to the Comintern</strong>, though he seems to have ended up on the wrong side of a factional struggle against Thälmann.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Martha Arendsee</h3>
                <p class="role">Women's Advocate; Pragmatist</p>
                
                <p>Rivaling even the venerable Zetkin, she represents the strong stance of the party on women's issues, but also serves as one of the leading communist publicists and organizers of charitable actions; she has <strong>always been willing to find coalition partners</strong>.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Position:</strong> More pragmatic than Thälmann. Open to tactical alliances if they advance the revolution.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-profile">
                <h3>Maria Reese</h3>
                <p class="role">Recent Convert from SPD</p>
                
                <p>A recent crossover from the SPD elected to the Reichstag by the SPD in 1928, she <strong>switched to the KPD in 1929</strong> due to the overly moderate stance of that party.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Proves that SPD is losing its most committed socialists to us.</p>

                <h4>⚠️ Moscow's Orders vs. Reality on the Ground</h4>
                <p>Stalin's Comintern directive is clear: <strong>The SPD are "social fascists"</strong> and must be treated as the main enemy. United Front with SPD is forbidden.</p>
                
                <p><strong>But...</strong></p>

                    <li>SA and Stahlhelm paramilitaries outnumber Red Front</li>
                    <li>Our Red Front is banned while SA remains legal</li>
                    <li>If NSDAP takes power, they will destroy us first</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>The debate within the party:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Thälmann faction:</strong> Obey Moscow. SPD are the enemy. After Hitler, our turn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pragmatists (Arendsee, some others):</strong> United Front with SPD to stop fascism</li>

                        <li><strong>Ideological clarity:</strong> We know what we want; others compromise and waver</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Completely isolated:</strong> Every other party opposes us; cannot form coalitions</li>
                        <li><strong>Red Front banned:</strong> Our paramilitary illegal while SA remains legal</li>
                        <li><strong>SPD hatred:</strong> Social fascism theory prevents United Front against NSDAP</li>
                        <li><strong>Moscow control:</strong> Must follow Comintern directives even if tactically unwise</li>
                        <li><strong>Failed uprisings:</strong> 1919, 1921, 1923 attempts discredited us; people fear chaos</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited beyond workers:</strong> Cannot appeal to middle class or rural voters</li>
                        <li><strong>Severing's crackdown:</strong> SPD interior minister brutal against us</li>

        <section id="game-role">
            <h2>Playing the KPD</h2>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Your Position in the Game</h4>
                <p>You are <strong>revolutionaries operating within a parliamentary system you seek to destroy</strong>. You have 54 seats, but no one will form a coalition with you. Your power comes from:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Disruption:</strong> Block legislation, force votes, create chaos</li>
                    <li><strong>Propaganda:</strong> Expose SPD betrayals, win workers to revolution</li>
                    <li><strong>Street action:</strong> Even with Red Front banned, organize protests and strikes</li>
                    <li><strong>Electoral growth:</strong> Every SPD compromise drives workers to us</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Strategic Considerations</h3>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>The United Front Question</h4>
                <p><strong>This is your biggest decision:</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Follow Moscow (Thälmann):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Treat SPD as main enemy</li>
                    <li>No cooperation with "social fascists"</li>
                    <li>"After Hitler, our turn" - fascism will discredit capitalism</li>
                    <li>Focus on winning SPD voters, not allying with SPD</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Defy Moscow (Pragmatists):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Form United Front with SPD against NSDAP</li>
                    <li>Fascism is the greater threat</li>
                    <li>Can't have revolution if we're all in concentration camps</li>
                    <li>Risk: Expulsion from Comintern, loss of Moscow funding</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>What will you choose?</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Tactical Alliances</h3>
            
            <p>Even if you can't form a coalition, you can vote tactically:</p>
            
            <ul style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>With NSDAP:</strong> Both oppose Young Plan, both want to destroy Republic - strange bedfellows?</li>
                <li><strong>With DNVP:</strong> Sometimes align on votes against SPD-led government</li>
                <li><strong>With agrarians:</strong> Support small farmer relief (but not Junker subsidies)</li>
                <li><strong>Mass walkouts:</strong> Refuse to participate in "bourgeois theater"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Victory Objectives</h3>
            
            <p>Your specific victory objectives will be on your role sheet, but generally the KPD seeks:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Increase seats in next election (grow beyond 15%)</li>
                <li>Discredit the SPD (expose their betrayals)</li>
                <li>Lift Red Front ban (restore paramilitary)</li>
                <li>Block SPD policies (make them fail)</li>
                <li>Lower Stability Index (create revolutionary conditions)</li>
                <li>Destabilize the Republic (bring crisis closer)</li>
                <li>If possible: Provoke insurrection</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h4>Remember</h4>
                <p>You do not want to save the Republic. You want to destroy it and build something better. <strong>Every crisis is an opportunity. Every compromise by the SPD proves you right.</strong></p>
