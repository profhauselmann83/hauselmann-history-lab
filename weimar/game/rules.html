All <strong>"mandatory items"</strong> must occur on the agenda at the start of the corresponding session and cannot be avoided. All <strong>"discretionary items"</strong> must be fought for to be placed on the agenda. Victory conditions are tied to the mandatory and discretionary items.</p>

            <p>Foreign policy debates revolve around how Germany should relate to the Versailles system.</p>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>The Freedom Law</h4>
                <p>The Freedom Law would make any cooperation with Versailles a treasonable offense. Can Germany risk offending the world community in the name of German honor?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>The Young Plan</h4>
                <p>The Young Plan would modify reparation payments and awaits Reichstag ratification. Would passing the Young Plan make reparations manageable or only kick the can down the road and simultaneously grant legitimacy to reparation payments?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>The Liquidation Treaty with Poland</h4>
                <p>The treaty resolves trade issues and limits the transfer of German property in Poland to Poles. Is this simply validating the annexation of German territory?</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Military Affairs -->
            <h3>Military Affairs (Defense Ministry)</h3>
            
            <p>Within the restrictions of Versailles, the Reichstag must grapple with the role of the largely autonomous Reichswehr, national security, and nongovernmental paramilitaries.</p>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>Naval Bill</h4>
                <p>The military demands full funding of three armored cruisers. Can an increased military budget be justified when social spending is being cut and would it risk the ire of the Allies?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>Paramilitaries</h4>
                <p>Political street violence is escalating. Should the Reichstag or president ban paramilitaries? A permanent ban would be a constitutional change and require a two-thirds majority.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>2nd and 3rd Naval Bills</h4>
                <p>Since the naval funding bill is an annual expenditure, it must come up in two later sessions as a discretionary item to continue funding; otherwise, funding stops.</p>

            <p>Modernization has challenged every notion of gender, sexual norms, reproduction, and national health, eliciting visceral responses.</p>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>Mother's Day versus International Women's Day</h4>
                <p>Competing visions of womanhood mean competing visions of a woman-centered national holiday. Can the Reichstag agree on what it means to be a German woman?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>Eugenics</h4>
                <p>The proposed Lex Zwickau advocates sterilization for various categories of people deemed "unproductive." Is this a great advance for national health or a descent into immorality?</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Race and Culture -->
            <h3>Race and Culture (Interior Ministry)</h3>
            
            <p>Germans disagree on who is rightfully German and thus entitled to citizenship with some proposing restrictions based on politics, religion, or even race. Others argue that the only way to unify Germany is to unify culture through censorship.</p>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>Antisemitism and the "Jewish Question"</h4>
                <p>No legislation restricting the rights of Jews has ever been proposed, but the strength of völkisch nationalism makes it a constant national issue. Should the Reichstag take a clear stance?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>Censorship and <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em></h4>
                <p>Everyone is talking about the book and movie. Should the Reichstag intervene to limit or possibly expand freedom of expression in this and future cases?</p>

            <p>In the growing economic crisis, scarce resources must be rationed against competing demands from the unemployed, agrarian constituents, big business, and the military.</p>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>Austerity</h4>
                <p>The budget is limited but unemployment is skyrocketing. Should unemployment insurance benefits to workers be cut to balance the looming deficit?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>Nationalization of the Banks</h4>
                <p>Many blame international banks for the economic crisis. Should the state step in and nationalize private property in the national interest? Should this include Aryanization of the banks by removing Jews from ownership?</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Agricultural Affairs -->
            <h3>Agricultural Affairs (Food Ministry)</h3>
            
            <p>The agrarian crisis has fractured the countryside, and calls for state intervention mount as rural foreclosures lead to violence and the specter of urban hunger.</p>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>Grain Tariffs</h4>
                <p>The powerful Junker class insists upon high tariffs to protect their estates from international competition, even if this raises food costs, drains state coffers, and does nothing for small farmers. Should the state placate this important constituency at this high cost?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="debate-topic">
                <h4>Small Farmers' Relief</h4>
                <p>Debt forgiveness or subsidized loans would protect small farmers from foreclosure, and land reform would confiscate and redistribute unproductive land. Would this only further distort the agrarian economy and violate property rights as a form of agro-Bolshevism?</p>

        <section id="president">
            <h2>Reich President (Head of State)</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Paul von Hindenburg</strong> has been the Reich president since 1925. His popularity is immense, in part because of his reputation as the greatest German general of the war. Even many socialists and National Socialists find him appealing as a symbol of German pride.</p>
            
            <p>The president does not directly shape legislation or exercise executive authority; these are left to the Reichstag and chancellor, respectively. However, <strong>the president does have a considerable amount of power</strong>, including:</p>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Presidential Powers</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Appointing the chancellor as head of government and approving the cabinet</strong> (Article 53).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Granting amnesty or pardon</strong> to anyone for any reason (Article 49).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Calling for new elections to the Reichstag</strong> at any time after the beginning of the second session (Article 25).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Issuing emergency decrees.</strong> These must be countersigned by the chancellor. The president may take emergency measures without the prior consent of the Reichstag. This power includes the promulgation of emergency decrees that amount to martial law and the temporary suspension of constitutional rights. The president, in cooperation with the chancellor, may, in effect, rule without the Reichstag, but the Reichstag may nullify emergency decrees (Articles 48 and 50).</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Presidential Government—The 25/48/53 Formula</h3>
            
            <p>There is the constitutional possibility of a constitutional but antidemocratic <strong>"presidential government"</strong> based on the so-called <strong>25/48/53 formula</strong>, which refers to the three articles of the constitution that could make a presidential government possible:</p>
            
            <ul style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Article 53</strong> allows the Reich president to appoint the chancellor</li>
                <li><strong>Article 48</strong> allows the Reich president to sign into law emergency bills without the consent of the Reichstag; the chancellor must simply countersign them</li>
                <li><strong>Article 25</strong> allows the president to dissolve the Reichstag if it overturns an emergency decree</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>⚠️ The Death of Democracy</h4>
                <p>In effect, the president could appoint a chancellor regardless of whether or not they control a majority in the Reichstag, as a minority government, and <strong>rule through emergency decrees without the Reichstag</strong> (see Figure 7).</p>

            <h3>Presidential Election</h3>
            
            <p>The president is elected separately from the Reichstag and directly by all German citizens to a <strong>seven-year term</strong>. A regular presidential election must be held in <strong>April 1932</strong> (the penultimate game session) unless a presidential recall has occurred.</p>
            
            <p>A presidential candidate must be a German citizen and may not be a member of the Reichstag. If a member of the Reichstag is elected, that member must resign from the Reichstag, but their party does not lose any votes.</p>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">

                <h4>ROUND 1</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Campaign Materials (Before Session 6):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every player develops an election poster for their ideal candidate (even if that candidate does not run)</li>
                    <li>Campaign materials are produced PRIOR to the election (usually due in session 5 for elections in session 6)</li>
                    <li>Posters may be hung in class or otherwise distributed</li>
                    <li>The GM (or class, at GM's discretion) ranks the posters prior to the election</li>

                <p><strong>Voting:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Candidates are announced and a secret vote is taken</li>
                    <li>Players designate their current votes (splitting, abstaining, or all for one candidate). Since it is a secret ballot, there is no party discipline</li>
                    <li>The GM makes adjustments based on ranking of posters and the Stability Index before announcing results</li>
                    <li>The winner requires a simple majority of votes cast</li>
                    <li>If no one wins an absolute majority, a second round is required</li>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>ROUND 2 (If Needed)</h4>
                
                <p>Any party with a candidate in the first round may choose to drop out or run a substitute candidate (but no new party or independent may put forward a candidate).</p>
                
                <p>It is possible for a candidate to run as unaffiliated, with the consent of one of the parties that ran a candidate in the first round but now withdraws their candidate and gives permission for the new candidate to run in their stead, even without using the party's affiliation.</p>
                
                <p>This second round occurs after a brief recess to allow caucusing, and it follows the same procedure as the first round.</p>

                <p>Upon election, the president must make the following presidential oath in front of the Reichstag:</p>
                
                <blockquote style="border-left: 5px solid var(--weimar-gold); padding-left: 1.5em; font-style: italic; margin: 1.5em 0;">

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Step 1: Reichstag Vote</h4>
                <p>Two-thirds of the Reichstag must vote for a recall. If the vote is unsuccessful, nothing happens; the regular presidential election will occur as scheduled in the penultimate session. If successful, the president may not exercise their powers, which devolve onto the chancellor, until a referendum is resolved.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Step 2: Referendum</h4>
                <p>The GM supervises a referendum by secret ballot, following the rules for a presidential election but with only one round and a simple "yes" or "no" for the current president. The question reads: <strong>"Shall the current Reich president remain in office?"</strong> This referendum must pass by a simple majority.</p>
                
                <p><strong>If the referendum results in a majority "yes":</strong> The president is considered reelected for a new seven-year term; the regularly scheduled presidential elections do not occur. The Reichstag is automatically dissolved and a Reichstag election is held.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Step 3: Presidential Election (If Recall Succeeds)</h4>
                <p>If the referendum results in a majority "no," an immediate new presidential election must occur, following all rules for a regular presidential election. Referendum posters may be reused for the presidential election.</p>

            <h3>The Camarilla</h3>
            
            <p>The <strong>Camarilla</strong> are the unofficial advisers around the Reich president:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kurt von Schleicher</strong> runs the political wing of the Reichswehr and is currently the defense minister</li>
                <li><strong>Otto Meissner</strong> is the state secretary to the Office of the Reich President, a career bureaucrat who served loyally under the former president, the socialist Friedrich Ebert</li>
                <li>There may be other members</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Though they wield tremendous personal influence, <strong>they have no formal constitutional role</strong> in their capacity as members of the Camarilla. The Camarilla and president sit together, apart from the parties.</p>

            <h3>Cabinet Responsibilities</h3>
            
            <p>The cabinet's primary role is to <strong>reach consensus and move legislation through the Reichstag by securing a majority in advance of any vote.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Protocol dictates that the minister with the relevant portfolio presents the government's position on any matter (unless the chancellor chooses to do so).</p>
            
            <p>Members of the cabinet are expected to publicly support the cabinet's decisions, or at least refrain from public criticism—<strong>a position that may put them at odds with their party.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>Ministerial Changes</h3>
            
            <p>A minister may resign at any time, or be voted out by a Reichstag vote of no confidence against the individual, or be kicked out by the chancellor. These will not necessarily bring down the government. The chancellor may replace the vacant seat as they please.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The ruling coalition loses a Reichstag majority for any reason: a party leaves the coalition; a party splits and reduces its numbers; an election changes the balance of power</li>
                    <li>The chancellor or the full cabinet lose a vote of no confidence in the Reichstag</li>

            <p>When the government collapses, the president may:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Call on someone (including the current chancellor) to form a new government</li>

                <li>Do nothing and allow a minority government</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>When forming a new government, the Reichstag works on a <strong>European parliamentary model</strong>:</p>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Majority Government</h4>
                <p>If a party has a majority (50 percent + 1 of votes in the Reichstag), the president usually but not necessarily calls on its leader to form a majority government.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Coalition Government</h4>
                <p>If there is no majority party, the president usually but not necessarily calls on the leader of the largest party to form a majority coalition government with other parties (the current coalition under Müller is such a government).</p>
                
                <p>If that party leader is able to form a majority coalition, they create a new government with a division of cabinet positions as the coalition partners agree, usually with the leader of the largest party as chancellor.</p>
                
                <p>There is no limit to how many parties can be involved in a coalition.</p>
                
                <p>If the party leader chosen by the president to form a government cannot create a cabinet acceptable to the president, the president may ask another character to attempt to form a government.</p>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Minority Government</h4>
                <p>The president may call on someone, including a person not in the Reichstag, to create a minority government. Lacking a majority, such a government has three legal options:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>A majority of the Reichstag may choose to <strong>"tolerate"</strong> the government (by abstaining, voting for its policies, and blocking any votes of no confidence), thus allowing the minority government to continue without necessitating a call for new elections.</li>
                    <li>It can rule by <strong>presidential decree</strong> (see "Presidential Government—The 25/48/53 Formula").</li>
                    <li>It can request that the president <strong>call for new elections</strong>.</li>

                    <li>During this time, the minister must answer all questions from the floor</li>
                    <li>The questioners do not approach the podium but must stand at their places and be recognized by the Speaker before asking</li>
                    <li>Questions must be in the form of a question (no speeches allowed—the Speaker will cut off any comments not in the form of a question and that person loses their right to raise a question)</li>
                    <li>After all questions, the minister may return to their place and normal debate ensues</li>

<!-- THE REICHSTAG -->
        <section id="reichstag">
            <h2>The Reichstag</h2>
            
            <p>The Reichstag is the German legislature. It operates according to <strong>parliamentary principles that differ from those in the United States</strong>, so make sure that you understand them. Every player (except those in the Camarilla) is a member of the Reichstag and sits with their party.</p>
            
            <h3>Speaker of the Reichstag</h3>
            
            <p>The Speaker is the presiding officer of the Reichstag, currently <strong>Paul Löbe (SPD)</strong>. The largest party in the Reichstag selects the Speaker immediately after every Reichstag election. Except in small games, the Speaker may not be in the cabinet.</p>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Speaker's Powers</h4>
                
                <p>The Speaker controls the agenda and enforces the podium rule, which determines who can speak, in what order, and for how long. The Speaker:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Calls sessions to order and announces the mandatory topic for discussion</li>
                    <li>May take motions from the floor</li>
                    <li>May recognize or ignore motions</li>
                    <li>Adjusts the agenda</li>
                    <li>Tables votes</li>
                    <li>Otherwise exercises authority over the proceedings of the Reichstag</li>
                    <li>May ignore requests to speak entirely, including from the chancellor or other members of the cabinet (but must always allow players to present on their topics)</li>
                    <li>At the end of each session, selects the discretionary agenda topics</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>If the Reichstag becomes unruly, the Speaker may call on the president to use whatever means necessary to restore order as long as it does not violate the constitutional immunity of the members of the Reichstag. The Speaker may select a secretary to help keep order; this role may be filled by the GM.</p>
            
            <h3>Voting in the Reichstag: Mandates</h3>
            
            <p>Mandates (seats in the Reichstag, each with a vote) per party are based on the results of the 1928 Reichstag election. Each player controls an equal share of their party mandates (and thus votes). If there is a remainder after dividing equally, extra mandates go to the party leader (player #1).</p>
            
            <p>The mandate distribution for Indeterminates depends on the number of Indeterminate players (the GM will provide these numbers—see Table 4).</p>
            
            <div class="key-concept">

            <h3>Decorum</h3>
            
            <p><strong>There is no protocol for behavior in the Reichstag.</strong> Heckling, interjecting, and voicing loud support may occur. The Speaker attempts to maintain order through the vigorous ringing of a bell to call the house to order, but members often ignore the Speaker. Members can enter or leave the meeting as they desire. Mass walkouts may occur.</p>
            
            <p>Players must verbally identify themselves by name, party affiliation, and ministry portfolio (if applicable) when speaking.</p>
            
            <p>When a member of the cabinet addresses the Reichstag to present the government's views, members of the Reichstag have the right to ask questions (see "Ministerial Reports and Questions for the Minister").</p>
            
            <h3>Varieties of Legislation</h3>
            
            <p>The members of the cabinet handle the day-to-day operations of the government, but they must secure the approval of the Reichstag whenever they take dramatic action.</p>

                <p><strong>Convene an inquiry committee</strong> headed by the justice minister. A committee investigates any activity as directed—scandals and assassinations are good reasons. Before the start of the next session after a committee is convened, the justice minister informs the cabinet privately about the committee's findings. The cabinet then authorizes a report to the Reichstag, usually given by the justice minister (Article 34).</p>

                    <li><strong>Vote no confidence.</strong> A successful vote forces the resignation of the chancellor, a minister, entire cabinet, or the Speaker. If directed against the chancellor or the entire cabinet, the president may call a new election or ask someone else to be chancellor, probably with a new cabinet.

If time allows, these items will be debated in the next session in the order set by the Speaker after the mandatory items have been resolved.</p>
            
            <div class="key-concept">

                    <li>Solicit input from Reichstag members</li>

                <p>Although the Speaker sets the discretionary agenda, <strong>the Reichstag may overrule by majority vote</strong> and set alternate discretionary agenda items.</p>

            <h2>Political Parties</h2>
            
            <h3>Party Discipline</h3>
            
            <p>All parties operate with <strong>party discipline</strong>. If a party calls for party discipline (determined by majority vote of party members), all members must vote as a block, with the party leader casting the vote. Failure to abide by party discipline can lead to disciplinary action by the party. If party discipline is not invoked, members may vote as they see fit.</p>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>What Members May Do</h4>
                <p>Members may always criticize their party privately, secretly, anonymously, and within party meetings.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>What Parties Forbid</h4>
                <p>Parties forbid public criticism such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Circulating critical articles</li>
                    <li>Voting against the decision after party discipline has been invoked</li>
                    <li>Conducting negotiations without the authorization of the party</li>
                    <li>Speaking in the Reichstag against their party or fellow members</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Disciplinary Actions</h3>
            
            <p>The game does not forbid public criticism. However, there should be consequences. It is up to the party to determine how to discipline members. The options may include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Expulsion from the party</li>
                <li>Removal from party posts</li>
                <li>A reprimand</li>
                <li>Reduction in party rank</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>A majority vote of all party members is required to discipline a member.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Only the GM may remove a member of the Reichstag from the legislature altogether.</p>
            
            <p>In the event of a tie in an internal party vote, the party leader decides.</p>
            
            <h3>Coalitions, Alliances, Mergers, New Formations, and Bans</h3>
            
            <h4>Coalitions</h4>
            
            <p>Coalitions are agreements between parties to form a government together. No single party has ever had an absolute majority of the Reichstag, so coalitions are the norm to achieve a working majority.</p>

            </div>
            
            <h4>Alliances</h4>
            
            <p>Alliances are formal agreements to vote together. These are not the same as mergers, since each party remains distinct, and they are not coalitions since they are not meant to form a government. Two alliances regularly discussed include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>United Front</strong> (KPD, SPD): A Marxist front to fight the extreme Right</li>
                <li><strong>National Block</strong> (DNVP, DVP, and other right-of-center parties): A conservative front to fight both the Marxists and the NSDAP</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Mergers</h4>
            
            <p>Mergers occur when two or more parties agree to dissolve their parties and create a new united party. Such a merger means that future elections occur under the name of the new party. <strong>There is no guarantee that all mandates of the merging parties will go along, however. The GM will determine how successful the merger was.</strong></p>
            
            <p>If the merger ceases to be useful, players can unmerge. Again, the GM will determine how successful the de-merger was.</p>
            
            <h4>Party Dissolution</h4>
            
            <p>Parties may disappear by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Voluntarily dissolving themselves</li>
                <li>Merging</li>
                <li>Being banned</li>
                <li>Not receiving any mandates in a Reichstag election</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Banning a Party</h4>
            
            <p><strong>Banning a party is an extraordinary step.</strong> It requires a two-thirds vote since it alters the constitutional right to association (Article 124). If banned, a party may reform under another name.</p>

            <h2>Reichstag Elections</h2>
            
            <h3>Scheduled Elections</h3>
            
            <p>If no Reichstag election is called prior to the penultimate game session, one must occur in that session (the four-year term would end in early 1932).</p>
            
            <p>If the regularly scheduled presidential election also occurs in that session (i.e., it has not been preempted by a successful recall referendum), the Reichstag elections would occur after the GM announces the new president.</p>
            
            <h3>Calling Elections</h3>
            
            <p>The president may call for early Reichstag elections at any time and for any reason after the start of the second session (Article 25). <strong>No more than one election may occur per session.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>Influencing Elections</h3>
            
            <p>Elections are unpredictable and the electorate volatile. Players may influence election by:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Campaigning successfully;</strong> as assessed in the quality of writing and speaking, the GM may adjust results</li>
                <li><strong>Moving the Stability Index:</strong> the GM may adjust results so that a higher Index favors pro-Republican parties, and a lower Index favors anti-Republican parties</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Election Results</h3>
            
            <p>After the GM announces the results of elections, the following happens:</p>
            
            <ol style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>The largest party selects the Speaker</li>
                <li>The president calls on someone (usually but not necessarily the leader of largest party) to form a new government as the new chancellor; that person need not be a member of the Reichstag</li>
                <li>The proposed chancellor consults with other parties, assembles a coalition, and proposes a cabinet to the president. If the president disapproves, they may ask for the same proposed chancellor to create a government more to their liking, or ask someone else to form a government to their liking</li>
                <li>If the president approves the government, the new chancellor presents the members of the cabinet and the goals of the new government to the Reichstag</li>
                <li>The new Speaker announces the agenda</li>
                <li>The eldest Reichstag member (Zetkin, KPD) addresses the Reichstag as the first agenda item (if Zetkin is not in play, this step is ignored)</li>

            <h2>Extraparliamentary Forces</h2>
            
            <h3>Assassination</h3>
            
            <p>Assassination by right-wing death squads was common in the early 1920s. But since 1924, assassination of leading politicians has all but ceased. Nonetheless, the threat still exists, and threats, often delivered in not-so-veiled homilies in the Reichstag, right-wing broadsheets, or in anonymous letters, should be taken seriously.</p>
            
            <h3>Foreign Intervention</h3>
            
            <p>Foreign powers may choose to intervene. The French intervened in the early 1920s and still occupy the Rhineland. The Comintern (the Moscow agency that coordinates international communism) has supported a variety of communist revolutions around the world. The Vatican regularly issues proclamations in support of Catholics. The United Kingdom has no desire to see the Versailles system unravel. Italy seeks to extend its influence into Austria and the Balkans. Poland and Czechoslovakia have significant tensions on their new borders with Germany.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Anyone may appeal to any foreign power for assistance</strong> (military, diplomatic, financial, or otherwise) by writing to the GM in their role as the relevant foreign counterpart. You will need to research who this counterpart might be.</p>
            
            <h3>Green Front</h3>
            
            <p>The <strong>Green Front</strong> is a nonparty block of often competing agrarian interests that was formed in 1929 with the hope of creating a single united organization that will ideally grow into a unified national agrarian party to strengthen farmers' voices.

            <p>Several parties have affiliated but autonomous paramilitaries with military-like training. These are (usually) legal and often intervene directly in political affairs. They may engage in street fighting and insurrections, and include:</p>

            <p>Since Versailles restricts the Reichswehr to one hundred thousand men, it has limited combat abilities. However, it is a handpicked elite led by conservative officers with monarchist loyalties who defend its autonomy from Reichstag control.</p>
            
            <p><strong>It appears to be utterly devoted to von Hindenburg, but von Schleicher makes day-to-day decisions.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>Character Death and Respawning</h3>
            
            <p>German politicians sometimes were assassinated, died unexpectedly, or lost all relevance. What happens if your character dies or your party is eliminated? Do you automatically lose?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Not to worry! You simply respawn, but as another character.</strong> The GM will inform you of your new character. Your victory objectives become those of your new character.</p>

        <!-- SESSION OUTLINE -->
        <section id="session-outline">
            <h2>Basic Outline of the Game</h2>
            
            <p>Our game begins in <strong>late 1929</strong>, just after the U.S. stock market crash and as the German Reichstag begins deliberation on the Freedom Law and Naval Bill. You are part of the Reichstag, belonging to one of the various political parties. Beginning with the Young Plan, you must debate a variety of matters ranging from foreign affairs to cultural matters, all informed by primary sources.</p>
            
            <p>Each session covers roughly six months of historical time, and you will have to confront unfolding events that directly impact Germany while also dealing with domestic elections and unrest. You face a series of events where <strong>you, not the dead hand of history, decide what will happen.</strong> Thus, within the parameters of the historical reality of the Republic, you must consider all of the options actually available and confront the consequences of your choices.</p>
            
            <p>Importantly, every decision made by you has an impact on the <strong>Stability Index</strong>, a measure of how volatile the German electorate has become: the greater the instability, the greater the radicalization of the German electorate. Thus you must decide how best to maneuver politically in the Reichstag, all the while considering the impact on the next election.</p>

                <h4>⚠️ When Parliamentary Democracy Fails</h4>
                <p>If the Reichstag cannot resolve its internal disputes based on majority rule, the game allows for a variety of tactics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dissolution of the Reichstag</li>
                    <li>Emergency decrees</li>
                    <li>Street violence</li>
                    <li>Martial law</li>
                    <li>Assassination</li>

            <p>After the game, the GM debriefs players, providing historical closure to determine the fate of German democracy and individual players. The debriefing also helps players to exit from the game, provides an opportunity for reflection, and gives the GM a chance to set the record straight by telling the players what really happened.</p>

            <h2>Assignments</h2>
            
            <p>Every player should engage the class through oral participation (speaking in the Reichstag sessions and caucusing), writing (your papers), and visual creativity (the campaign poster).</p>
            
            <p><strong>For detailed assignment requirements, grading rubrics, and victory points, see the <a href="assignments.html">Assignments page</a>.</strong></p>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Oral Participation</h4>
                <p>Depending on class size, the GM will inform you how often and at what length you must speak before the Reichstag to receive full credit. In smaller classes, you should expect to speak on a daily basis; in larger classes perhaps only once per week.</p>
                
                <p>Some characters are required to speak on set matters. Hugenberg (DNVP) speaks on the Freedom Law. Clara Zetkin delivers the "First Address" after any Reichstag election. Cabinet members present the government's views, often triggered by GM updates.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Papers</h4>
                <p>Depending on the GM's need, you will write two papers (3–5 pages) or three papers (2–4 pages). Your role sheet defines your topics. The GM will provide length and citation expectations. In general, though, you must draw on the "Core Texts" and factional readings.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Visual Creativity (Election Poster)</h4>
                <p>You must produce an election poster for the presidential election for your preferred candidate (listed in your role sheet) prior to the start of the election (usually the penultimate session, unless preempted by a successful presidential recall referendum). You are not obligated to vote for this candidate.</p>
                
                <p>The poster should be on a half poster board (14″ × 22″) unless otherwise specified by the GM. It may be designed in any style related to the aesthetics of the era; you may imitate models or be more creative.</p>
