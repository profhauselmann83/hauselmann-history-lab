            <h2>Welcome to the Reichstag</h2>
            
            <div class="historical-context">
                <p>It is October 1929. You are a member of the German Reichstag during one of 
                history's most critical moments. The "Golden Twenties" are ending. The American 
                stock market has just crashed. Unemployment is rising. Political extremists on both 
                the left and right are gaining strength.</p>
                
                <p>Germany's young democracy—only ten years old—faces its greatest test. The 
                moderate parties that have governed since 1919 are fracturing. Communists demand 
                revolution. Nazis promise a "new Germany" based on racial purity and authoritarian 
                rule. Street violence is escalating. The economy is collapsing.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Will you preserve democracy? Will you compromise your principles for 
                stability? Will you risk everything for your ideals?</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-facts">
                <h3>The Stakes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>You represent one of 12 political parties</strong> in the Reichstag, each with different visions for Germany's future</li>
                    <li><strong>No party has a majority</strong>—coalition-building is essential, but your parties fundamentally disagree</li>
                    <li><strong>Every decision affects the Stability Index</strong>—push it too low and democracy collapses</li>
                    <li><strong>History is not predetermined</strong>—your choices will determine whether Germany remains democratic or falls into dictatorship</li>
                    <li><strong>You will face impossible dilemmas</strong>—between your principles and political survival, between democracy and order, between compromise and conviction</li>

                <div class="challenge">
                    <h3>💰 Economic Crisis</h3>
                    <p>The Treaty of Versailles demands impossible reparations payments. American 
                    loans that sustained the recovery are being recalled. Unemployment is soaring 
                    past 3 million. Farmers face bankruptcy.</p>
                    <p><strong>The question:</strong> Do you impose austerity and cut unemployment 
                    benefits to balance the budget? Or do you maintain social spending and risk 
                    economic collapse?</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="challenge">
                    <h3>⚔️ Political Extremism</h3>
                    <p>Communists (KPD) want Soviet-style revolution. National Socialists (NSDAP) 
                    demand an authoritarian racial state. Nationalists (DNVP) want to restore the 
                    monarchy. Each rejects parliamentary democracy.</p>
                    <p><strong>The question:</strong> Can moderate parties (SPD, Centre, Liberals) 
                    hold the center? Or will Germans turn to extremism in desperation?</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="challenge">
                    <h3>🔥 Street Violence</h3>
                    <p>Paramilitary groups clash in German streets: the Nazi SA (Storm Troopers), 
                    the Communist Red Front, the Social Democratic Reichsbanner. Each numbers in 
                    the hundreds of thousands. The police are overwhelmed.</p>
                    <p><strong>The question:</strong> Do you ban the paramilitaries and risk civil 
                    war? Or tolerate political violence and watch democracy erode?</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="challenge">
                    <h3>📜 Constitutional Crisis</h3>
                    <p>President Hindenburg—a monarchist who despises democracy—can rule by emergency 
                    decree (Article 48). He can dissolve the Reichstag and call new elections. The 
                    military (Reichswehr) operates beyond democratic control.</p>
                    <p><strong>The question:</strong> Will you use authoritarian tools to "save" 
                    democracy? Or watch as anti-democratic forces use those same tools to destroy it?</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="challenge">
                    <h3>🌍 Foreign Relations</h3>
                    <p>All Germans hate the Treaty of Versailles. But challenging it risks French 
                    invasion, international isolation, and economic catastrophe. The Young Plan 
                    offers relief—but requires accepting the "war guilt lie."</p>
                    <p><strong>The question:</strong> Do you accept humiliation for stability? Or 
                    risk everything to restore German honor?</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="challenge">
                    <h3>🗳️ Democratic Fragility</h3>
                    <p>Proportional representation means 12+ parties in the Reichstag. No stable 
                    majority is possible. Coalition governments collapse constantly. Voters are 
                    losing faith in democracy.</p>
                    <p><strong>The question:</strong> Can you make democracy work? Or will gridlock 
                    and chaos prove that Germany needs a "strong hand"?</p>

            <strong>Treaty of Versailles Territorial Revisions (1919):</strong> 
            Germany lost 13% of its territory and 10% of its population. Alsace-Lorraine 
            returned to France (west). The "Polish Corridor" (West Prussia, Posen, and 
            Danzig) was ceded to Poland, cutting off East Prussia from the rest of Germany. 
            Northern Schleswig went to Denmark. Eupen-Malmedy to Belgium. Upper Silesia to 
            Poland and Czechoslovakia. The Rhineland and Saarland were occupied by French 
            troops. <strong>No German political party accepted these borders as legitimate.</strong>

            occupying almost two-thirds of Germany. East Prussia (exclave, cut off by the Polish

            dominated the military and hated democracy. Yet "Red" Berlin, Hamburg, and the Ruhr 
            were bastions of Social Democracy. <span style="color: var(--centre-black); font-weight: 700;">Bavaria</span> 
            (Free State)—conservative, Catholic, monarchist, separatist—was home to both the Centre

        <h4>Why These Maps Matter for the Simulation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Polish Corridor</strong> is THE most explosive issue in German politics. 
            Every party—from Communists to Nazis—rejects it. Debates over foreign policy will 
            center on whether to challenge Versailles.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Lebensraum ideology</strong> (Penck's map) shows how nationalists thought. 
            The NSDAP and DNVP don't just want 1914 borders back—they want a racial empire 
            stretching into Eastern Europe.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Regional divisions</strong> matter. Prussian Junkers (East Prussia) vs. 
            Bavarian Catholics (BVP) vs. "Red" Berlin (SPD) create deep cultural and political 
            fractures. You'll see this in coalition-building.</li>
            
            <li><strong>The stakes:</strong> Every debate about foreign policy, military affairs, 
            or the Young Plan connects to these maps. Accepting Versailles means accepting "national 
            humiliation." Rejecting it risks French invasion and economic catastrophe.</li>

            <div class="historical-context">
                <p><strong>October 3, 1929:</strong> Gustav Stresemann, Germany's Foreign Minister 
                and architect of international rehabilitation, dies suddenly at age 51. His death 
                removes a crucial stabilizing figure from German politics.</p>
                
                <p><strong>October 24, 1929:</strong> "Black Thursday." The New York Stock Exchange 
                crashes. Within days, American banks begin calling in loans to Germany. The fragile 
                economic recovery—built entirely on American credit—is ending.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Late October 1929:</strong> The "Grand Coalition" government debates the 
                Young Plan (reducing reparations) and unemployment insurance. Chancellor Hermann 
                Müller (SPD) struggles to hold his coalition together.</p>

                    and call for revolution. "The Republic is capitalist tyranny!"</li>
                    
                    <li>The <strong>Nazis (NSDAP)</strong> and <strong>Nationalists (DNVP)</strong>
